beautiful command line interfaces in a composable way with as little code as necessary. It's the \"Command Line Interface Creation Kit\". It's highly configurable but comes with sensible defaults out of the box.\nIt aims to make the process of writing command line tools quick and fun while also preventing any frustration caused by the inability to implement an intended CLI API.\nClick in three points:\n  * Arbitrary nesting of commands\n  * Automatic help page generation\n  * Supports lazy loading of subcommands at runtime\n\n\n## A Simple Example\n[](https://github.com/pallets/click/#a-simple-example)\n```\nimport click\n@click.command()\n@click.option(\"--count\", default=1, help=\"Number of greetings.\")\n@click.option(\"--name\", prompt=\"Your name\", help=\"The person to greet.\")\ndef hello(count, name):\n  \"\"\"Simple program that greets NAME for a total of COUNT times.\"\"\"\n  for _ in range(count):\n    click.echo(f\"Hello, {name}!\")\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n  hello()\n```\n\n```\n$ python hello.py --count=3\nYour name: Click\nHello, Click!\nHello, Click!\nHello, Click!\n\n```\n\n## Donate\n[](https://github.com/pallets/click/#donate)\nThe Pallets organization develops and supports Click and other popular packages.
