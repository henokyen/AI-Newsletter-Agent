Example code and guides for accomplishing common tasks with the [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/introduction). To run these examples, you'll need an OpenAI account and associated API key ([create a free account here](https://beta.openai.com/signup)). Set an environment variable called `OPENAI_API_KEY` with your API key. Alternatively, in most IDEs such as Visual Studio Code, you can create an `.env` file at the root of your repo containing `OPENAI_API_KEY=<your API key>`, which will be picked up by the notebooks.
Most code examples are written in Python, though the concepts can be applied in any language.
