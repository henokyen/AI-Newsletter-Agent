Camelot also comes packaged with a [command-line interface](https://camelot-py.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/cli.html)!
Refer to the [QuickStart Guide](https://github.com/camelot-dev/camelot/blob/main/docs/user/quickstart.rst#quickstart) to quickly get started with Camelot, extract tables from PDFs and explore some basic options.
**Tip:** Visit the `parser-comparison-notebook` to get an overview of all the packed parsers and their features.

**Note:** Camelot only works with text-based PDFs and not scanned documents. (As Tabula [explains](https://github.com/tabulapdf/tabula#why-tabula), "If you can click and drag to select text in your table in a PDF viewer, then your PDF is text-based".)
You can check out some frequently asked questions [here](https://camelot-py.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/faq.html).
## Why Camelot?
[](https://github.com/camelot-dev/camelot/#why-camelot)
  * **Configurability** : Camelot gives you control over the table extraction process with [tweakable settings](https://camelot-py.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/advanced.html).
  * **Metrics** : You can discard bad tables based on metrics like accuracy and whitespace, without having to manually look at each table.
  * **Output** : Each table is extracted into a **pandas DataFrame** , which seamlessly integrates into [ETL and data analysis workflows](https://gist.github.com/vinayak-mehta/e5949f7c2410a0e12f25d3682dc9e873). You can also export tables to multiple formats, which include CSV, JSON, Excel, HTML, Markdown, and Sqlite.
