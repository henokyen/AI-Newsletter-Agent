Graph Databases should be the better choice for Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)! RAG systems are usually pretty bad at retrieving the right context! The retrieved information is very local to the original documents, and it might be tricky to get the documents that actually relate to the user query. That is where Microsoft GraphRAG can provide a solution! There are 2 important pieces. First, we are going to create summaries of the different documents at different scales. This way, we are going to be able to understand, overall, what global information is contained in the full documents, as well as the local information contained in smaller chunks of text. Second, we are going to reduce the textual information to its graphical form. The assumption is that the information contained in the text can be represented as a set of nodes and edges. This allows the representation of the full information contained in the text as a knowledge base that can be stored in a graph database. The data indexing pipeline is as follows: 1) We chunk the original documents into sub-texts. 2) We extract the entities, their relationships, and their descriptions in a structured format by using an LLM. 3) We resolve the duplicate entities and relationships we can find across the different text chunks. We can summarize the different descriptions into more complete ones. 4) We build the graph representation of the entities and their relationships 5) From the graph, we cluster the different entities into communities in a hierarchical manner by using the Leiden algorithm. Each entity belongs to multiple clusters depending on the scale of the clusters. 6) For each community, we summarize it by using the entity and relationship descriptions. We have multiple summaries for each entity representing the different scales of the communities. At retrieval time, we can convert the user query by extracting keywords for a lexical search and a vector representation for a semantic search. From the search, we get entities, and from the entities, we get their related community summaries. Those summaries are used as context in the prompt at generation time to answer the user query. And because we only understand things once we implement them, here is my implementation of GraphRAG: [https://lnkd.in/gpCxJG4k](https://www.linkedin.com/redir/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Flnkd%2Ein%2FgpCxJG4k&urlhash=t7ar&trk=public_post-text) -- 👉 Don't forget to subscribe to my ML newsletter [https://lnkd.in/g4iKyRmS](https://www.linkedin.com/redir/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Flnkd%2Ein%2Fg4iKyRmS&urlhash=d2mG&trk=public_post-text) --

The weakest link still is that LLM that is downstream from all this impressive information retrieval machinery.. It will take all these 'facts' and generate some random bs still. What I am really curious about is the total lack of research and dev for new types of Transformer architectures that would actually integrate RAG. Or come uo with mechanisms for gauging overall plausibility of the output. Or even assign plausibility scores to generated answers or parts of it. Or that would switch to greedier decoding based on input classification or data availability in whatever underlying lexical stores. For example, data missing in lexical stores could potentially indicate lower plausibility scores and indicate that the model should dynamically tune temperature and repetition penalty and possibly reduce the beam search width or even switch to argmax altogether when selecting attention derived probability distribution logit weights.

Hi, I was looking at your implementation and see the indexing code. But how do I retrieve? Did you use one of the other examples to do the retrieval?

It is well known that GPT models (aka LLMs) are not the best option when working with information extraction tasks. Their performance is worse than, for example, BERT based models: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14450](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14450?trk=public_post_comment-text) Unsupervised ontology learning from text is an example of an specific task where approaches previous to the chatagpt hype are still considered SOTA. Things as classic (and generally unknown by the new AI experts) as grammar dendency parsers are still being actively used succesfully for these tasks.

GraphRAG is a nice evolution in RAG systems. One thing I'm curious about is scalability … how does the system handle extremely large, dynamic graphs where entity relationships might frequently change? Would this require periodic re-clustering or incremental updates, and how would that impact real-time performance?

Transforming text into graph-based representations solves many limitations of traditional RAG systems. But graph construction and entity resolution can be computationally expensive for large datasets. Are there optimizations in place to handle real-time scaling, especially in rapidly evolving knowledge bases?

A powerful and interesting approach, [Damien Benveniste, PhD](https://www.linkedin.com/in/damienbenveniste?trk=public_post_comment-text)! Extracting entities and their relationships can not only help overcome certain limitations of RAG but also deduce additional facts from the knowledge domain in question. I am personally very interested in domain representation for a study aid project for students with specific learning disabilities that I am working on in my spare time. Is there any way I can access a visualization of the generated graph that gives me an idea of the system's power? Thank you!

Graph Databases should be the better choice for Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)! RAG systems are usually pretty bad at retrieving the right context! The retrieved information is very local to the original documents, and it might be tricky to get the documents that actually relate to the user query. That is where Microsoft GraphRAG can provide a solution! There are 2 important pieces. First, we are going to create summaries of the different documents at different scales. This way, we are going to be able to understand, overall, what global information is contained in the full documents, as well as the local information contained in smaller chunks of text. Second, we are going to reduce the textual information to its graphical form. The assumption is that the information contained in the text can be represented as a set of nodes and edges. This allows the representation of the full information contained in the text as a knowledge base that can be stored in a graph database. The data indexing pipeline is as follows: 1) We chunk the original documents into sub-texts. 2) We extract the entities, their relationships, and their descriptions in a structured format by using an LLM. 3) We resolve the duplicate entities and relationships we can find across the different text chunks. We can summarize the different descriptions into more complete ones. 4) We build the graph representation of the entities and their relationships 5) From the graph, we cluster the different entities into communities in a hierarchical manner by using the Leiden algorithm. Each entity belongs to multiple clusters depending on the scale of the clusters. 6) For each community, we summarize it by using the entity and relationship descriptions. We have multiple summaries for each entity representing the different scales of the communities. At retrieval time, we can convert the user query by extracting keywords for a lexical search and a vector representation for a semantic search. From the search, we get entities, and from the entities, we get their related community summaries. Those summaries are used as context in the prompt at generation time to answer the user query. And because we only understand things once we implement them, here is my implementation of GraphRAG: [https://lnkd.in/gpCxJG4k](https://www.linkedin.com/redir/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Flnkd%2Ein%2FgpCxJG4k&urlhash=t7ar&trk=public_post_reshare-text) -- 👉 Don't forget to subscribe to my ML newsletter [https://lnkd.in/g4iKyRmS](https://www.linkedin.com/redir/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Flnkd%2Ein%2Fg4iKyRmS&urlhash=d2mG&trk=public_post_reshare-text) --

LangChain’s Parent Document Retriever — Revisited [https://ift.tt/A4z1SvY](https://www.linkedin.com/redir/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Fift%2Ett%2FA4z1SvY&urlhash=xPq0&trk=public_post-text) LangChain’s Parent Document Retriever — Revisited Enhance retrieval with context using your vector database only TL;DR — We achieve the same functionality as LangChains’ Parent Document Retriever (link) by utilizing metadata queries. You can explore the code here. Introduction to RAG Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is currently one of the hottest topics in the world of LLM and AI applications. In short, RAG is a technique for grounding a generative models’ response on chosen knowledge sources. It comprises two phases: retrieval and generation. In the retrieval phase, given a user’s query, we retrieve pieces of relevant information from a predefined knowledge source. Then, we insert the retrieved information into the prompt that is sent to an LLM, which (ideally) generates an answer to the user’s question based on the provided context. A commonly used approach to achieve efficient and accurate retrieval is through the usage of embeddings. In this approach, we preprocess users’ data (let’s assume plain text for simplicity) by splitting the documents into chunks (such as pages, paragraphs, or sentences). We then use an embedding model to create a meaningful, numerical representation of these chunks, and store them in a vector database. Now, when a query comes in, we embed it as well and perform a similarity search using the vector database to retrieve the relevant information Image by the author If you are completely new to this concept, I’d recommend [deeplearning.ai](https://www.linkedin.com/redir/redirect?url=http%3A%2F%2Fdeeplearning%2Eai&urlhash=EbqT&trk=public_post-text) great course, LangChain: Chat with Your Data. What is “Parent Document Retrieval”? “Parent Document Retrieval” or “Sentence Window Retrieval” as referred by others, is a common approach to enhance the performance of retrieval methods in RAG by providing the LLM with a broader context to consider. In essence, we divide the original documents into relatively small chunks, embed each one, and store them in a vector database. Using such small chunks (a sentence or a couple of sentences) helps the embedding models to better reflect their meaning [1]. Then, at retrieval time, we do not return the most similar chunk as found by the vector database only, but also its surrounding context (chunks) in the original document. That way, the LLM will have a broader context, which, in many cases, helps generate better answers. LangChain supports this concept via Parent Document Retriever [2]. The Parent Document Retriever allows you to: (1) retrieve the full document a specific chunk originated from, or (2) pre-define a larger “parent” chunk, for each smaller chunk associated with that parent. Let’s explore the example from LangChains’ docs: # This text splitter is used to create the parent documents parent_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=2000) # This text splitter is used to create the child documents # It should create documents smaller than the...

The [#RAG](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Frag&trk=public_post_reshare-text) approach might not be as easy as you think. Effective retrieval is a pain, and you can encounter several issues during this important stage. Here are some common pain points and possible solutions in the retrival stage. ⮕ Challenge: Retrieved data not in context & there can be several reasons for this. ➤ Missed Top Rank Documents: The system sometimes doesn’t include essential documents that contain the answer in the top results returned by the system’s retrieval component. ➤ Incorrect Specificity: Responses may not provide precise information or adequately address the specific context of the user’s query ➤ Losing Relevant Context During Reranking: This occurs when documents containing the answer are retrieved from the database but fail to make it into the context for generating an answer. ⮕ Proposed Solutions: ➤ Query Augmentation: Query augmentation enables RAG to retrieve information that is in context by enhancing the user queries with additional contextual details or modifying them to maximize relevancy. This involves improving the phrasing, adding company-specific context, and generating sub-questions that help contextualize and generate accurate responses - Rephrasing - Hypothetical document embeddings - Sub-queries ➤ Tweak retrieval strategies: Llama Index offers a range of retrieval strategies, from basic to advanced, to ensure accurate retrieval in RAG pipelines. By exploring these strategies, developers can improve the system’s ability to incorporate relevant information into the context for generating accurate responses. - Small-to-big sentence window retrieval, - recursive retrieval - semantic similarity scoring. ➤ Hyperparameter tuning for chunk size and similarity_top_k: This solution involves adjusting the parameters of the retrieval process in RAG models. More specifically, we can tune the parameters related to chunk size and similarity_top_k. The chunk_size parameter determines the size of the text chunks used for retrieval, while similarity_top_k controls the number of similar chunks retrieved. By experimenting with different values for these parameters, developers can find the optimal balance between computational efficiency and the quality of retrieved information. ➤ Reranking: Reranking retrieval results before they are sent to the language model has proven to improve RAG systems’ performance significantly. This reranking process can be implemented by incorporating the reranker as a postprocessor in the RAG pipeline.

The [#RAG](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Frag&trk=public_post_reshare-text) approach might not be as easy as you think. Effective retrieval is a pain, and you can encounter several issues during this important stage. Here are some common pain points and possible solutions in the retrival stage. ⮕ Challenge: Retrieved data not in context & there can be several reasons for this. ➤ Missed Top Rank Documents: The system sometimes doesn’t include essential documents that contain the answer in the top results returned by the system’s retrieval component. ➤ Incorrect Specificity: Responses may not provide precise information or adequately address the specific context of the user’s query ➤ Losing Relevant Context During Reranking: This occurs when documents containing the answer are retrieved from the database but fail to make it into the context for generating an answer. ⮕ Proposed Solutions: ➤ Query Augmentation: Query augmentation enables RAG to retrieve information that is in context by enhancing the user queries with additional contextual details or modifying them to maximize relevancy. This involves improving the phrasing, adding company-specific context, and generating sub-questions that help contextualize and generate accurate responses - Rephrasing - Hypothetical document embeddings - Sub-queries ➤ Tweak retrieval strategies: Llama Index offers a range of retrieval strategies, from basic to advanced, to ensure accurate retrieval in RAG pipelines. By exploring these strategies, developers can improve the system’s ability to incorporate relevant information into the context for generating accurate responses. - Small-to-big sentence window retrieval, - recursive retrieval - semantic similarity scoring. ➤ Hyperparameter tuning for chunk size and similarity_top_k: This solution involves adjusting the parameters of the retrieval process in RAG models. More specifically, we can tune the parameters related to chunk size and similarity_top_k. The chunk_size parameter determines the size of the text chunks used for retrieval, while similarity_top_k controls the number of similar chunks retrieved. By experimenting with different values for these parameters, developers can find the optimal balance between computational efficiency and the quality of retrieved information. ➤ Reranking: Reranking retrieval results before they are sent to the language model has proven to improve RAG systems’ performance significantly. This reranking process can be implemented by incorporating the reranker as a postprocessor in the RAG pipeline.

𝗩𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗼𝗿 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮𝗯𝗮𝘀𝗲❓ With the rise of Foundational Models, Vector Databases skyrocketed in popularity. The truth is that a Vector Database is also useful outside of a Large Language Model context. When it comes to Machine Learning, we often deal with Vector Embeddings. Vector Databases were created to perform specifically well when working with them: ☑️Storing. ☑️Updating. ☑️Retrieving. When we talk about retrieval, we refer to retrieving set of vectors that are most similar to a query in a form of a vector that is embedded in the same Latent space. This retrieval procedure is called Approximate Nearest Neighbour (ANN) search. A query here could be in a form of an object like an image for which we would like to find similar images. Or it could be a question for which we want to retrieve relevant context that could later be transformed into an answer via a LLM. Let’s look into how one would interact with a Vector Database: 𝗪𝗿𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴/𝗨𝗽𝗱𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮. 1. Choose a ML model to be used to generate Vector Embeddings. 2. Embed any type of information: text, images, audio, tabular. Choice of ML model used for embedding will depend on the type of data. 3. Get a Vector representation of your data by running it through the Embedding Model. 4. Store additional metadata together with the Vector Embedding. This data would later be used to pre-filter or post-filter ANN search results. 5. Vector DB indexes Vector Embedding and metadata separately. There are multiple methods that can be used for creating vector indexes, some of them: Random Projection, Product Quantization, Locality-sensitive Hashing. 6. Vector data is stored together with indexes for Vector Embeddings and metadata connected to the Embedded objects. 𝗥𝗲𝗮𝗱𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮. 6. Queries executed against a Vector Database typically consist of two components: ▪️ Data for ANN search: For instance, an image for which similar results are sought. ▪️ Metadata query: Used to exclude or include vectors with specific pre-known characteristics. For example, when searching for similar apartment images, you might exclude results based on location. 7. Metadata Query Execution: ▪️ Perform the metadata query on the metadata index, which can occur either before or after the ANN search process. 8. Embedding Query Data: ▪️ Convert your query data into vector embeddings using the same embedding model initially used to store data in the Vector Database. 9. ANN Search Procedure: ▪️ Apply the ANN search process to retrieve a set of vector embeddings most similar to the query vector. Common similarity measures include: 🔹 Cosine Similarity 🔹 Euclidean Distance 🔹 Dot Product hashtag [#Question](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Fquestion&trk=public_post-text): How are you using Vector DBs?
