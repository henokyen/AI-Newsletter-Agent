Go for it. Spin up Codespaces from any device with internet access. Donât worry if your device is powerful enoughâCodespaces lives in the cloud.\n### Onboard at the speed of thought\nNo more building your dev environment while you onboard. Codespaces launches instantly from any repository on GitHub with pre-configured, secure environments.\n### Streamline contractor onboarding\nCodespaces gives you control over how your consultants access your resources, while providing them with instant onboarding and a fluid developer experience.\n### Fix bugs right from a pull request\nGot a pull request detailing a bug or security issue? Open Codespaces right from the pull request without waiting for your dev environment to load.\n## What developers are saying\nâ\n> What used to be a 15-step process is just one step: open Codespaces and youâre off and running.\n![Circular avatar from Clint Chester's GitHub profile](https://github.com/images/modules/site/codespaces/fp24/testimonials-avatar-clint.png)Clint ChesterDeveloper Lead, Synergy\nâ\n> Codespacesâ¦ lets developers skip the tedious, error-prone stuff that normally stands between them and getting started on real work.\n![Circular avatar from Keith Annette's GitHub profile](https://github.com/images/modules/site/codespaces/fp24/testimonials-avatar-keith.png)Keith AnnetteCloud Capability Lead, KPMG, UK\n### Start coding in seconds with Codespaces\nGo to any repository and open your own Codespaces environment instantly.\n[Get started](https://github.com/codespaces)[Contact Sales](https://github.com/enterprise/contact?ref_cta=Contact+sales&ref_loc=cta-banner&ref_page=%2Ffeatures%2Fcodespaces&utm_content=Platform&utm_medium=site&utm_source=github)\n### Frequently asked questions\n#### How does Codespaces work?\nA codespace is a development environment thatâs hosted in the cloud. Customize your project for GitHub Codespaces by [configuring dev container files](https://docs.github.com/codespaces/customizing-your-codespace/configuring-codespaces-for-your-project) to your repository (often known as configuration-as-code), which creates a repeatable codespace configuration for all users of your project.\nGitHub Codespaces run on a various VM-based compute options hosted by GitHub.com, which you can configure from 2 core machines up to 32 core machines. Connect to your codespaces from the browser or locally using an IDE like Visual Studio Code or IntelliJ.\n#### How do I use Codespaces?\nThere are a number of entry points to spin up a Codespaces environment, including:\n  * A [template](https://docs.github.com/codespaces/getting-started/quickstart).\n  * [Your repository](https://docs.github.com/codespaces/developing-in-codespaces/creating-a-codespace#creating-a-codespace) for new feature work\n  * An [open pull request](https://docs.github.com/codespaces/developing-in-codespaces/using-github-codespaces-for-pull-requests#opening-a-pull-request-in-codespaces) to explore work-in-progress\n  * A commit in the repositoryâs history to investigate a bug at a specific point in time\n  * [Visual Studio Code](https://docs.github.com/codespaces/developing-in-codespaces/using-github-codespaces-in-visual-studio-code#creating-a-codespace-in-vs-code)\n  * In beta, can you also use your [JetBrains IDE](https://docs.github.com/codespaces/developing-in-a-codespace/using-github-codespaces-in-your-jetbrains-ide) or [JupyterLab](https://docs.github.com/codespaces/developing-in-a-codespace/getting-started-with-github-codespaces-for-machine-learning)\n\n\nLearn more about how to use Codespaces in our [documentation](https://docs.github.com/codespaces/overview).\n#### Is Codespaces available for individual developers?\nCodespaces is available for developers in every organization, and under the control of the organization who pays for the userâs codespace. All personal (individual) GitHub.com accounts include a quota of free usage each month, which organizations can enable (see the next question) for their private and internal repositories. GitHub will provide users in the free plan 120 core hours or 60 hours of run time on a 2 core codespace, plus 15 GB of storage each month. See how itâs balanced on the [billing page](https://github.com/settings/billing).\n#### Is Codespaces available for teams and companies?\nCodespaces is available for teams and companies, but needs to be enabled first in an organizationâs settings. Teams and companies can select which repositories and users have access to Codespaces for added security and permissioning control. Learn how to [enable Codespaces in an organization in our docs](https://docs.github.com/codespaces/managing-codespaces-for-your-organization/enabling-github-codespaces-for-your-organization).\n#### How much does Codespaces cost?\nCodespaces is free for individual use up to 60 hours a month and comes with simple, pay-as-you-go pricing after that. Itâs also available for organizations with pay-as-you-go pricing and has pricing controls so any company or team can determine how much they want to spend a month. Learn more about Codespaces pricing for organizations [here](https://docs.github.com/billing/managing-billing-for-github-codespaces/about-billing-for-github-codespaces).\n#### Can I self-host Codespaces?\nCodespaces cannot be self-hosted.\n#### How do I access Codespaces with LinkedIn Learning?\nYou can use Codespaces directly through LinkedIn Learning. LinkedIn Learning offers 50+ courses across six of the most popular coding languages, as well as data science and machine learning. These courses are integrated with Codespaces, so you can get hands-on practice anytime, from any machine via LinkedIn. These courses will be unlocked on LinkedIn Learning for free through Feb. 2023. Learn more about LinkedIn Learning and GitHub Codespaces [here](https://learning.linkedin.com/product/hands-on-practice).\n#### How do I enable Codespaces on GitHub?\nCodespaces is on by default for developers with a GitHub free account. If you belong to an organization, there may be a policy that prevents cloningâbut if you can clone a repository, you will be able to start using Codespaces. Organizations will also need to pay for, enable, and manage their Codespaces instances.\n#### Is Codespaces available for students?\nCodespaces is available for free to students as part of the GitHub Student Developer Pack. Learn more about how to sign up and start using Codespaces and other GitHub products [here](https://education.github.com/pack).\n#### Is Codespaces available for open source maintainers?\nCodespaces provides both maintainers and contributors with [generous free monthly usage](https://docs.github.com/billing/managing-billing-for-github-codespaces/about-billing-for-github-codespaces#monthly-included-storage-and-core-hours-for-personal-accounts).\n## Site-wide Links\n[ ](https://github.com/)\n### Subscribe to our developer newsletter\nGet tips, technical guides, and best practices.
