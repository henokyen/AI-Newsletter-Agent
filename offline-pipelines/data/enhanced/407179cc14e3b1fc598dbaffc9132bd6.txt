The OG code genereation experimentation platform!
If you are looking for the evolution that is an opinionated, managed service – check out gptengineer.app.
If you are looking for a well maintained hackable CLI for – check out aider.
gpt-engineer lets you:
  * Specify software in natural language
  * Sit back and watch as an AI writes and executes the code
  * Ask the AI to implement improvements


## Getting Started
[](https://github.com/gpt-engineer-org/gpt-engineer/#getting-started)
### Install gpt-engineer
[](https://github.com/gpt-engineer-org/gpt-engineer/#install-gpt-engineer)
For **stable** release:
  * `python -m pip install gpt-engineer`


For **development** :
  * `git clone https://github.com/gpt-engineer-org/gpt-engineer.git`
  * `cd gpt-engineer`
  * `poetry install`
  * `poetry shell` to activate the virtual environment


We actively support Python 3.10 - 3.12. The last version to support Python 3.8 - 3.9 was [0.2.6](https://pypi.org/project/gpt-engineer/0.2.6/).
### Setup API key
[](https://github.com/gpt-engineer-org/gpt-engineer/#setup-api-key)
Choose **one** of:
  * Export env variable (you can add this to .bashrc so that you don't have to do it each time you start the terminal) 
    * `export OPENAI_API_KEY=[your api key]`
  * .env file: 
    * Create a copy of `.env.template` named `.env`
    * Add your OPENAI_API_KEY in .env
  * Custom model: 
    * See [docs](https://gpt-engineer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/open_models.html), supports local model, azure, etc.


Check the [Windows README](https://github.com/AntonOsika/gpt-engineer/blob/main/WINDOWS_README.md) for Windows usage.
**Other ways to run:**
  * Use Docker ([instructions](https://github.com/AntonOsika/gpt-engineer/blob/main/docker/README.md))
  * Do everything in your browser: [![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://github.com/gpt-engineer-org/gpt-engineer/codespaces)


### Create new code (default usage)
[](https://github.com/gpt-engineer-org/gpt-engineer/#create-new-code-default-usage)
  * Create an empty folder for your project anywhere on your computer
  * Create a file called `prompt` (no extension) inside your new folder and fill it with instructions
  * Run `gpte <project_dir>` with a relative path to your folder 
    * For example: `gpte projects/my-new-project` from the gpt-engineer directory root with your new folder in `projects/`


### Improve existing code
[](https://github.com/gpt-engineer-org/gpt-engineer/#improve-existing-code)
  * Locate a folder with code which you want to improve anywhere on your computer
  * Create a file called `prompt` (no extension) inside your new folder and fill it with instructions for how you want to improve the code
  * Run `gpte <project_dir> -i` with a relative path to your folder 
    * For example: `gpte projects/my-old-project -i` from the gpt-engineer directory root with your folder in `projects/`


### Benchmark custom agents
[](https://github.com/gpt-engineer-org/gpt-engineer/#benchmark-custom-agents)
  * gpt-engineer installs the binary 'bench', which gives you a simple interface for benchmarking your own agent implementations against popular public datasets.
  * The easiest way to get started with benchmarking is by checking out the [template](https://github.com/gpt-engineer-org/gpte-bench-template) repo, which contains detailed instructions and an agent template.
  * Currently supported benchmark: 
    * [APPS](https://github.com/hendrycks/apps)
    * [MBPP](https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/mbpp)


The community has started work with different benchmarking initiatives, as described in [this Loom](https://www.loom.com/share/206805143fbb4302b5455a5329eaab17?sid=f689608f-8e49-44f7-b55f-4c81e9dc93e6) video.
### Research
[](https://github.com/gpt-engineer-org/gpt-engineer/#research)
Some of our community members have worked on different research briefs that could be taken further. See [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qmOj2DvdPc6syIAm8iISZFpfik26BYw7ZziD5c-9G0E/edit?usp=sharing) if you are interested.
## Terms
[](https://github.com/gpt-engineer-org/gpt-engineer/#terms)
By running gpt-engineer, you agree to our [terms](https://github.com/gpt-engineer-org/gpt-engineer/blob/main/TERMS_OF_USE.md).
## Relation to gptengineer.app (GPT Engineer)
[](https://github.com/gpt-engineer-org/gpt-engineer/#relation-to-gptengineerapp-gpt-engineer)
[gptengineer.app](https://gptengineer.app/) is a commercial project for the automatic generation of web apps. It features a UI for non-technical users connected to a git-controlled codebase. The gptengineer.app team is actively supporting the open source community.
## Features
[](https://github.com/gpt-engineer-org/gpt-engineer/#features)
### Pre Prompts
[](https://github.com/gpt-engineer-org/gpt-engineer/#pre-prompts)
You can specify the "identity" of the AI agent by overriding the `preprompts` folder with your own version of the `preprompts`. You can do so via the `--use-custom-preprompts` argument.
Editing the `preprompts` is how you make the agent remember things between projects.
### Vision
[](https://github.com/gpt-engineer-org/gpt-engineer/#vision)
By default, gpt-engineer expects text input via a `prompt` file. It can also accept image inputs for vision-capable models. This can be useful for adding UX or architecture diagrams as additional context for GPT Engineer. You can do this by specifying an image directory with the `—-image_directory` flag and setting a vision-capable model in the second CLI argument.
E.g. `gpte projects/example-vision gpt-4-vision-preview --prompt_file prompt/text --image_directory prompt/images -i`
### Open source, local and alternative models
[](https://github.com/gpt-engineer-org/gpt-engineer/#open-source-local-and-alternative-models)
By default, gpt-engineer supports OpenAI Models via the OpenAI API or Azure OpenAI API, as well as Anthropic models.
With a little extra setup, you can also run with open source models like WizardCoder. See the [documentation](https://gpt-engineer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/open_models.html) for example instructions.
## Mission
[](https://github.com/gpt-engineer-org/gpt-engineer/#mission)
The gpt-engineer community mission is to **maintain tools that coding agent builders can use and facilitate collaboration in the open source community**.
If you are interested in contributing to this, we are interested in having you.
