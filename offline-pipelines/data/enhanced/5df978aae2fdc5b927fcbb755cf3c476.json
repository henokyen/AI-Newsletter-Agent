However, it can be hard to find structured information on what those best practices actually are and how a company can become more mature in terms of MLOps if they decide to start on that journey.\nOur questionnaire covers a wide range of MLOps aspects, making it a valuable resource for teams looking to improve their MLOps practices.\n  1. Documentation\n  2. Traceability & Reproducibility\n  3. Code quality\n  4. Monitoring & Support\n  5. Data transformation pipelines & Feature store\n  6. Model explainability\n  7. A/B testing & Feedback loop\n\n\nWe believe that a machine learning project can be considered MLOps mature if all statements in sections 1–4 (documentation, traceability & reproducibility, code quality, monitoring & support) can be answered with “yes”. This is the bare minimum required to deploy a machine learning project reliably in production. Sections 5–7 go beyond basic MLOps maturity, and it is possible to work on its implementation while some of the statements in sections 1–4 haven’t been covered. However, we encourage everyone to prioritize the basics before moving on to advanced MLOps practices. This questionnaire makes MLOps actionable by clearly highlighting areas for improvement: If some of the statements are answered with a “no,” it’s a clear indicator of what needs to be addressed to improve your MLOps maturity.\nFor more details, see our blog: <https://medium.com/marvelous-mlops/mlops-maturity-assessment-7e6df189077b>\n## About\nMLOps maturity assessment \n### Resources\n[ Readme ](https://github.com/marvelousmlops/mlops_maturity_assessment/#readme-ov-file)\n### License\n[ MIT license ](https://github.com/marvelousmlops/mlops_maturity_assessment/#MIT-1-ov-file)\n[ Activity](https://github.com/marvelousmlops/mlops_maturity_assessment/activity)\n[ Custom properties](https://github.com/marvelousmlops/mlops_maturity_assessment/custom-properties)\n### Stars\n[ **60** stars](https://github.com/marvelousmlops/mlops_maturity_assessment/stargazers)\n### Watchers\n[ **2** watching](https://github.com/marvelousmlops/mlops_maturity_assessment/watchers)\n### Forks\n[ **9** forks](https://github.com/marvelousmlops/mlops_maturity_assessment/forks)\n[ Report repository ](https://github.com/contact/report-content?content_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fmarvelousmlops%2Fmlops_maturity_assessment&report=marvelousmlops+%28user%29)\n##  [Releases](https://github.com/marvelousmlops/mlops_maturity_assessment/releases)\nNo releases published\n##  [Packages 0](https://github.com/orgs/marvelousmlops/packages?repo_name=mlops_maturity_assessment)\nNo packages published \n## Footer\n[ ](https://github.com \"GitHub\") © 2025 GitHub, Inc. \n### Footer navigation\n  * [Terms](https://docs.github.com/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-of-service)\n  * [Privacy](https://docs.github.com/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement)\n  * [Security](https://github.com/security)\n  * [Status](https://www.githubstatus.com/)\n  * [Docs](https://docs.github.com/)\n  * [Contact](https://support.github.com?tags=dotcom-footer)\n  * Manage cookies \n  * Do not share my personal information \n\n\nYou can’t perform that action at this time. \n",
