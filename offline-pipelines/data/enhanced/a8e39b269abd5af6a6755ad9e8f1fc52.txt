This tutorial assumes you have Docker, VSCode, git and npm installed.
### ð§± AutoGPT Frontend
[](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/AutoGPT/#-autogpt-frontend)
The AutoGPT frontend is where users interact with our powerful AI automation platform. It offers multiple ways to engage with and leverage our AI agents. This is the interface where you'll bring your AI automation ideas to life:
**Agent Builder:** For those who want to customize, our intuitive, low-code interface allows you to design and configure your own AI agents.
**Workflow Management:** Build, modify, and optimize your automation workflows with ease. You build your agent by connecting blocks, where each block performs a single action.
**Deployment Controls:** Manage the lifecycle of your agents, from testing to production.
**Ready-to-Use Agents:** Don't want to build? Simply select from our library of pre-configured agents and put them to work immediately.
**Agent Interaction:** Whether you've built your own or are using pre-configured agents, easily run and interact with them through our user-friendly interface.
**Monitoring and Analytics:** Keep track of your agents' performance and gain insights to continually improve your automation processes.
[Read this guide](https://docs.agpt.co/platform/new_blocks/) to learn how to build your own custom blocks.
### ð½ AutoGPT Server
[](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/AutoGPT/#-autogpt-server)
The AutoGPT Server is the powerhouse of our platform This is where your agents run. Once deployed, agents can be triggered by external sources and can operate continuously. It contains all the essential components that make AutoGPT run smoothly.
**Source Code:** The core logic that drives our agents and automation processes.
**Infrastructure:** Robust systems that ensure reliable and scalable performance.
**Marketplace:** A comprehensive marketplace where you can find and deploy a wide range of pre-built agents.
### ð Example Agents
[](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/AutoGPT/#-example-agents)
Here are two examples of what you can do with AutoGPT:
  1. **Generate Viral Videos from Trending Topics**
     * This agent reads topics on Reddit.
     * It identifies trending topics.
     * It then automatically creates a short-form video based on the content.
  2. **Identify Top Quotes from Videos for Social Media**
     * This agent subscribes to your YouTube channel.
     * When you post a new video, it transcribes it.
     * It uses AI to identify the most impactful quotes to generate a summary.
     * Then, it writes a post to automatically publish to your social media.


These examples show just a glimpse of what you can achieve with AutoGPT! You can create customized workflows to build agents for any use case.
### Mission and Licencing
[](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/AutoGPT/#mission-and-licencing)
Our mission is to provide the tools, so that you can focus on what matters:
  * ðï¸ **Building** - Lay the foundation for something amazing.
  * ð§ª **Testing** - Fine-tune your agent to perfection.
  * ð¤ **Delegating** - Let AI work for you, and have your ideas come to life.


Be part of the revolution! **AutoGPT** is here to stay, at the forefront of AI innovation.

## ð¤ AutoGPT Classic
[](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/AutoGPT/#-autogpt-classic)
> Below is information about the classic version of AutoGPT.
**ð ï¸[Build your own Agent - Quickstart](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/AutoGPT/blob/master/classic/FORGE-QUICKSTART.md)**
### ðï¸ Forge
[](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/AutoGPT/#ï¸-forge)
**Forge your own agent!** â Forge is a ready-to-go toolkit to build your own agent application. It handles most of the boilerplate code, letting you channel all your creativity into the things that set _your_ agent apart. All tutorials are located [here](https://medium.com/@aiedge/autogpt-forge-e3de53cc58ec). Components from [`forge`](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/AutoGPT/blob/master/classic/forge) can also be used individually to speed up development and reduce boilerplate in your agent project.
ð [**Getting Started with Forge**](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/AutoGPT/blob/master/classic/forge/tutorials/001_getting_started.md) â This guide will walk you through the process of creating your own agent and using the benchmark and user interface.

### ð¯ Benchmark
[](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/AutoGPT/#-benchmark)
**Measure your agent's performance!** The `agbenchmark` can be used with any agent that supports the agent protocol, and the integration with the project's [CLI](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/AutoGPT/#-cli) makes it even easier to use with AutoGPT and forge-based agents. The benchmark offers a stringent testing environment. Our framework allows for autonomous, objective performance evaluations, ensuring your agents are primed for real-world action.

### ð» UI
[](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/AutoGPT/#-ui)
**Makes agents easy to use!** The `frontend` gives you a user-friendly interface to control and monitor your agents. It connects to agents through the [agent protocol](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/AutoGPT/#-agent-protocol), ensuring compatibility with many agents from both inside and outside of our ecosystem.
The frontend works out-of-the-box with all agents in the repo. Just use the [CLI](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/AutoGPT/#-cli) to run your agent of choice!
ð [Learn More](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/AutoGPT/tree/master/classic/frontend) about the Frontend
### â¨ï¸ CLI
[](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/AutoGPT/#ï¸-cli)
To make it as easy as possible to use all of the tools offered by the repository, a CLI is included at the root of the repo:
```
$ ./run
Usage: cli.py [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...
Options:
 --help Show this message and exit.
Commands:
 agent   Commands to create, start and stop agents
 benchmark Commands to start the benchmark and list tests and categories
 setup   Installs dependencies needed for your system.
```

Just clone the repo, install dependencies with `./run setup`, and you should be good to go!
