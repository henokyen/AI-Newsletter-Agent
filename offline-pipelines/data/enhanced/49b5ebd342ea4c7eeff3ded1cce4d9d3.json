NV-Ingest includes support for parsing PDFs, text files, Microsoft Word and PowerPoint documents, plain images, and audio files. NV-Ingest uses specialized NVIDIA NIMs (self-hosted microservices, or hosted on build.nvidia.com) to find, contextualize, and extract text, tables, charts, and unstructured images that you can use in downstream generative applications.\nNote\nNVIDIA Ingest is also known as NV-Ingest and [NeMo Retriever Extraction](https://docs.nvidia.com/nemo/retriever/extraction/overview/).\nNVIDIA Ingest enables parallelization of the process of splitting documents into pages where contents are classified (as tables, charts, images, text), extracted into discrete content, and further contextualized via optical character recognition (OCR) into a well defined JSON schema. From there, NVIDIA Ingest can optionally manage computation of embeddings for the extracted content, and also optionally manage storing into a vector database [Milvus](https://milvus.io/).\n[![Pipeline Overview](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/2bd5170792fa9b64a19b774fb50dcdf8acef3d37cf5fdf5a91e3531583a45d7a/68747470733a2f2f646f63732e6e76696469612e636f6d2f6e656d6f2f7265747269657665722f65787472616374696f6e2f696d616765732f6f766572766965772d65787472616374696f6e2e706e67)](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/2bd5170792fa9b64a19b774fb50dcdf8acef3d37cf5fdf5a91e3531583a45d7a/68747470733a2f2f646f63732e6e76696469612e636f6d2f6e656d6f2f7265747269657665722f65787472616374696f6e2f696d616765732f6f766572766965772d65787472616374696f6e2e706e67)\n### Table of Contents\n[](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nv-ingest/#table-of-contents)\n  1.

[Notices](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nv-ingest/#notices)\n\n\n## Introduction\n[](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nv-ingest/#introduction)\n## What NVIDIA-Ingest Is ✔️\n[](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nv-ingest/#what-nvidia-ingest-is-️)\nNV-Ingest is a library and microservice service that does the following:\n  * Accept a job specification that contains a document payload and a set of ingestion tasks to perform on that payload.\n  * Store the result of each job to retrieve later. The result is a dictionary that contains a list of metadata that describes the objects extracted from the base document, and processing annotations and timing/trace data.\n  * Support multiple methods of extraction for each document type to balance trade-offs between throughput and accuracy. For example, for .pdf documents nv-ingest supports extraction through pdfium, [nemoretriever-parse](https://build.nvidia.com/nvidia/nemoretriever-parse), Unstructured.io, and Adobe Content Extraction Services.\n  * Support various types of before and after processing operations, including text splitting and chunking, transform and filtering, embedding generation, and image offloading to storage.\n\n\nNV-Ingest supports the following file types:\n  * `pdf`\n  * `docx`\n  * `pptx`\n  * `jpeg`\n  * `png`\n  * `svg`\n  * `tiff`\n  * `txt`\n\n\n## Prerequisites\n[](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nv-ingest/#prerequisites)\nFor production-level performance and scalability, we recommend that you deploy the pipeline and supporting NIMs by using Docker Compose or Kubernetes ([helm charts](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nv-ingest/blob/release/25.3.0/helm)). For more information, refer to [prerequisites](https://docs.nvidia.com/nv-ingest/user-guide/getting-started/prerequisites).\n## Library Mode Quickstart\n[](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nv-ingest/#library-mode-quickstart)\nFor small-scale workloads, such as workloads of fewer than 100 PDFs, you can use library mode setup. Library mode set up depends on NIMs that are already self-hosted, or, by default, NIMs that are hosted on build.nvidia.com.\nLibrary mode deployment of nv-ingest requires:\n  * Linux operating systems (Ubuntu 22.04 or later recommended)\n  * [Conda Python environment and package manager](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge)\n  * Python 3.10\n\n\n### Step 1: Prepare Your Environment\n[](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nv-ingest/#step-1-prepare-your-environment)\nCreate a fresh conda environment in which to install nv-ingest and dependencies.\n```\nconda create -y --name nvingest python=3.10 && \\\n  conda activate nvingest && \\\n  conda install -y -c rapidsai -c conda-forge -c nvidia nv_ingest=25.3.0 nv_ingest_client=25.3.0 nv_ingest_api=25.3.0 && \\\n  pip install opencv-python llama-index-embeddings-nvidia pymilvus 'pymilvus[bulk_writer, model]' milvus-lite nvidia-riva-client unstructured-client\n```\n\nMake sure to set your NVIDIA_BUILD_API_KEY and NVIDIA_API_KEY. If you don't have one, you can get one on [build.nvidia.com](https://build.nvidia.com/nvidia/llama-3_2-nv-embedqa-1b-v2?snippet_tab=Python&signin=true&api_key=true).\n```\n#Note: these should be the same value\nexport NVIDIA_BUILD_API_KEY=nvapi-...\nexport NVIDIA_API_KEY=nvapi-...\n\n```\n\n### Step 2: Ingest Documents\n[](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nv-ingest/#step-2-ingest-documents)\nYou can submit jobs programmatically in Python.\nNote: Make sure your conda environment is activated. `which python` should indicate that you're using the conda provided python installation (not an OS provided python).\n```\nwhich python\n/home/dev/miniforge3/envs/nvingest/bin/python\n\n```\n\nIf you have a very high number of CPUs and see the process hang without progress, we recommend using taskset to limit the number of CPUs visible to the process:\n```\ntaskset -c 0-3 python your_ingestion_script.py\n\n```\n\nOn a 4 CPU core low end laptop, the following should take about 10 seconds:\n```\nimport logging, os, time, sys\n        \nfrom nv_ingest.util.pipeline.pipeline_runners import start_pipeline_subprocess\nfrom nv_ingest_client.client import Ingestor, NvIngestClient\nfrom nv_ingest_client.message_clients.simple.simple_client import SimpleClient\nfrom nv_ingest.util.pipeline.pipeline_runners import PipelineCreationSchema\nfrom nv_ingest_client.util.process_json_files import ingest_json_results_to_blob\n# Start the pipeline subprocess for library mode\nconfig = PipelineCreationSchema()\npipeline_process = start_pipeline_subprocess(config)\n# you can configure the subprocesses to log stderr to stdout for debugging purposes\n#pipeline_process = start_pipeline_subprocess(config, stderr=sys.stderr, stdout=sys.stdout)\nclient = NvIngestClient(\n  message_client_allocator=SimpleClient,\n  message_client_port=7671,\n  message_client_hostname=\"localhost\"\n)\n                      \n# Note: gpu_cagra accelerated indexing is not yet available in milvus-lite\n# Provide a filename for milvus_uri to use milvus-lite\nmilvus_uri = \"milvus.db\"\ncollection_name = \"test\"\nsparse=False\n# do content extraction from files\ningestor = (\n  Ingestor(client=client)\n  .files(\"data/multimodal_test.pdf\")\n  .extract(\n    extract_text=True,\n    extract_tables=True,\n    extract_charts=True,\n    extract_images=True,\n    paddle_output_format=\"markdown\",\n    extract_infographics=True,\n    # Slower, but maximally accurate, especially for PDFs with pages that are scanned images\n    #extract_method=\"nemoretriever_parse\",\n    text_depth=\"page\"\n  ).embed()\n  .vdb_upload(\n    collection_name=collection_name,\n    milvus_uri=milvus_uri,\n    sparse=sparse,\n    # for llama-3.2 embedder, use 1024 for e5-v5\n    dense_dim=2048\n  )\n)\nprint(\"Starting ingestion..\")\nt0 = time.time()\nresults = ingestor.ingest(show_progress=True)\nt1 = time.time()\nprint(f\"Time taken: {t1-t0} seconds\")\n# results blob is directly inspectable\nprint(ingest_json_results_to_blob(results[0]))\n```\n\nYou can see the extracted text that represents the content of the ingested test document.\n```\nStarting ingestion..\nTime taken: 9.243880033493042 seconds\nTestingDocument\nA sample document with headings and placeholder text\nIntroduction\nThis is a placeholder document that can be used for any purpose.

Perhaps the Cat was in a hurry while typing and introduced the error?\nSo, according to this whimsical analysis, both the **Giraffe** and the **Cat** are \"responsible\" for the typos, with the Giraffe possibly being the more egregious offender given the more blatant character substitution in its name.\n```\n\nFor more information, please check out the [official documentation](https://docs.nvidia.com/nemo/retriever/extraction/overview/).\nTip\nBeyond inspecting the results, you can read them into things like [llama-index](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nv-ingest/blob/release/25.3.0/examples/llama_index_multimodal_rag.ipynb) or [langchain](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nv-ingest/blob/release/25.3.0/examples/langchain_multimodal_rag.ipynb) retrieval pipelines.\nPlease also checkout our [demo using a retrieval pipeline on build.nvidia.com](https://build.nvidia.com/nvidia/multimodal-pdf-data-extraction-for-enterprise-rag) to query over document content pre-extracted w/ NVIDIA Ingest.\n## Repo Structure\n[](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nv-ingest/#repo-structure)\nBeyond the relevant documentation, examples, and other links above, below is a description of the contents in this repo's folders:\n  * [.github](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nv-ingest/tree/main/.github): GitHub repo configuration files\n  * [api](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nv-ingest/tree/main/api): Core API python logic shared across python modules\n  * [ci](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nv-ingest/tree/main/ci): Scripts used to build the NV-Ingest container and other packages\n  * [client](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nv-ingest/tree/main/client): Docs and source code for the nv-ingest-cli utility\n  * [conda](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nv-ingest/tree/main/conda): Conda environment and packaging definitions\n  * [config](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nv-ingest/tree/main/config): Various .yaml files defining configuration for OTEL, Prometheus\n  * [data](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nv-ingest/tree/main/data): Sample PDFs provided for testing convenience\n  * [deploy](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nv-ingest/tree/main/deploy): Brev.dev hosted launchable\n  * [docker](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nv-ingest/tree/main/docker): Houses scripts used by the nv-ingest docker container\n  * [docs](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nv-ingest/tree/main/docs/docs): Various READMEs describing deployment, metadata schemas, auth and telemetry setup\n  * [evaluation](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nv-ingest/tree/main/evaluation): Contains notebooks demonstrating how to test recall accuracy\n  * [examples](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nv-ingest/tree/main/examples): Example notebooks, scripts, and longer-form tutorial content\n  * [helm](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nv-ingest/tree/main/helm): Documentation for deploying NV-Ingest to a Kubernetes cluster via Helm chart\n  * [skaffold](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nv-ingest/tree/main/skaffold): Skaffold configuration\n  * [src](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nv-ingest/tree/main/src): Source code for the NV-Ingest pipelines and service\n  * [.devcontainer](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nv-ingest/tree/main/.devcontainer): VSCode containers for local development\n  * [tests](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nv-ingest/tree/main/tests): Unit tests for NV-Ingest\n\n\n## Notices\n[](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nv-ingest/#notices)\n### Third Party License Notice:\n[](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nv-ingest/#third-party-license-notice)\nIf configured to do so, this project will download and install additional third-party open source software projects.
