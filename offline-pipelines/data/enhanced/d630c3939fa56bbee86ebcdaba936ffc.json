In general, the memory for an agent is something that we provide via context in the prompt passed to LLM that helps the agent to better plan and react given past interactions or data not immediately available. It is useful to group the memory into four types: 𝟭. Episodic - This type of memory contains past interactions and actions performed by the agent. After an action is taken, the application controlling the agent would store the action in some kind of persistent storage so that it can be retrieved later if needed. A good example would be using a vector Database to store semantic meaning of the interactions. 𝟮. Semantic - Any external information that is available to the agent and any knowledge the agent should have about itself. You can think of this as a context similar to one used in RAG applications. It can be internal knowledge only available to the agent or a grounding context to isolate part of the internet scale data for more accurate answers. 𝟯. Procedural - This is systemic information like the structure of the System Prompt, available tools, guardrails etc. It will usually be stored in Git, Prompt and Tool Registries. 𝟰. Occasionally, the agent application would pull information from long-term memory and store it locally if it is needed for the task at hand. 𝟱. All of the information pulled together from the long-term or stored in local memory is called short-term or working memory. Compiling all of it into a prompt will produce the prompt to be passed to the LLM and it will provide further actions to be taken by the system. We usually label 1. - 3. as Long-Term memory and 5. as Short-Term memory. A visual explanation of potential implementation details 👇 And that is it! The rest is all about how you architect the flow of your Agentic systems. What do you think about memory in AI Agents?

This process enables the agent to utilize past experiences and stored knowledge to provide contextually relevant answers.\n[ Like  ](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Elinkedin%2Ecom%2Fposts%2Faurimas-griciunas_llm-ai-machinelearning-activity-7284520203705610240-gkSj&trk=public_post_comment_like) [ Reply  ](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Elinkedin%2Ecom%2Fposts%2Faurimas-griciunas_llm-ai-machinelearning-activity-7284520203705610240-gkSj&trk=public_post_comment_reply) [ 5 Reactions ](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Elinkedin%2Ecom%2Fposts%2Faurimas-griciunas_llm-ai-machinelearning-activity-7284520203705610240-gkSj&trk=public_post_comment_reactions) 6 Reactions \n[ ](https://fr.linkedin.com/in/mzmmoazam?trk=public_post_comment_actor-image)\n[ Mohammad Moazam ](https://fr.linkedin.com/in/mzmmoazam?trk=public_post_comment_actor-name)\nLLM Tech Lead @ Stellantis | NLP | Computer Vision | Technomancer\n2mo \n  * [ Report this comment ](https://www.linkedin.com/uas/login?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fposts%2Faurimas-griciunas_llm-ai-machinelearning-activity-7284520203705610240-gkSj&trk=public_post_comment_ellipsis-menu-semaphore-sign-in-redirect&guestReportContentType=COMMENT&_f=guest-reporting)\n\n\nLove the illustration [Aurimas Griciūnas](https://lt.linkedin.com/in/aurimas-griciunas?trk=public_post_comment-text)\n[ Like  ](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Elinkedin%2Ecom%2Fposts%2Faurimas-griciunas_llm-ai-machinelearning-activity-7284520203705610240-gkSj&trk=public_post_comment_like) [ Reply  ](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Elinkedin%2Ecom%2Fposts%2Faurimas-griciunas_llm-ai-machinelearning-activity-7284520203705610240-gkSj&trk=public_post_comment_reply) [ 3 Reactions ](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Elinkedin%2Ecom%2Fposts%2Faurimas-griciunas_llm-ai-machinelearning-activity-7284520203705610240-gkSj&trk=public_post_comment_reactions) 4 Reactions \n[ ](https://au.linkedin.com/in/johnnycosgrove?trk=public_post_comment_actor-image)\n[ John (JC) Cosgrove ](https://au.linkedin.com/in/johnnycosgrove?trk=public_post_comment_actor-name)\nPartner @ Cloudwerx || Founder and former CEO Lightfold || Advisor, Speaker, Strategist and Practitioner for Applied Generative and Agentic AI + Data || Total Lunatic\n2mo \n  * [ Report this comment ](https://www.linkedin.com/uas/login?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fposts%2Faurimas-griciunas_llm-ai-machinelearning-activity-7284520203705610240-gkSj&trk=public_post_comment_ellipsis-menu-semaphore-sign-in-redirect&guestReportContentType=COMMENT&_f=guest-reporting)\n\n\nI like your four classifications and they are now my canon :-) I will cite you wherever I use it [Aurimas Griciūnas](https://lt.linkedin.com/in/aurimas-griciunas?trk=public_post_comment-text)\n[ Like  ](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Elinkedin%2Ecom%2Fposts%2Faurimas-griciunas_llm-ai-machinelearning-activity-7284520203705610240-gkSj&trk=public_post_comment_like) [ Reply  ](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Elinkedin%2Ecom%2Fposts%2Faurimas-griciunas_llm-ai-machinelearning-activity-7284520203705610240-gkSj&trk=public_post_comment_reply) [ 3 Reactions ](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Elinkedin%2Ecom%2Fposts%2Faurimas-griciunas_llm-ai-machinelearning-activity-7284520203705610240-gkSj&trk=public_post_comment_reactions) 4 Reactions \n[ ](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/tarunsonania?trk=public_post_comment_actor-image)\n[ Tarun S. ](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/tarunsonania?trk=public_post_comment_actor-name)\nData Architect | Data Management | Data Strategy | Data Product\n2mo \n  * [ Report this comment ](https://www.linkedin.com/uas/login?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fposts%2Faurimas-griciunas_llm-ai-machinelearning-activity-7284520203705610240-gkSj&trk=public_post_comment_ellipsis-menu-semaphore-sign-in-redirect&guestReportContentType=COMMENT&_f=guest-reporting)\n\n\nAs always, like the visualization to ease learnings (the concepts).

In general, the memory for an agent is something that we provide via context in the prompt passed to LLM that helps the agent to better plan and react given past interactions or data not immediately available. It is useful to group the memory into four types: 𝟭. Episodic - This type of memory contains past interactions and actions performed by the agent. After an action is taken, the application controlling the agent would store the action in some kind of persistent storage so that it can be retrieved later if needed. A good example would be using a vector Database to store semantic meaning of the interactions. 𝟮. Semantic - Any external information that is available to the agent and any knowledge the agent should have about itself. You can think of this as a context similar to one used in RAG applications. It can be internal knowledge only available to the agent or a grounding context to isolate part of the internet scale data for more accurate answers. 𝟯. Procedural - This is systemic information like the structure of the System Prompt, available tools, guardrails etc. It will usually be stored in Git, Prompt and Tool Registries. 𝟰. Occasionally, the agent application would pull information from long-term memory and store it locally if it is needed for the task at hand. 𝟱. All of the information pulled together from the long-term or stored in local memory is called short-term or working memory. Compiling all of it into a prompt will produce the prompt to be passed to the LLM and it will provide further actions to be taken by the system. We usually label 1. - 3. as Long-Term memory and 5. as Short-Term memory. A visual explanation of potential implementation details 👇 And that is it!

Eg you want to deeply understand the business to break down jobs to stable tasks (that’s the hard part) that can complement and later replace / scale existing jobs made of hundreds of tasks. The smaller the task / the more stable it will be. Hugging Face has a cool approach to do that it seems (programmatic), and Lang graph is also interesting. Microsoft seems to push the idea of general standard agents on top of memory management with context windows expanding crazy this year, it means stable tasks’ output will be more and more complex aligned with Eric Schmidt vision —- back to 2025 for me, you will see me between estonia / silicon valley!

It is useful to group the memory into four types: 𝟭. Episodic - This type of memory contains past interactions and actions performed by the agent. After an action is taken, the application controlling the agent would store the action in some kind of persistent storage so that it can be retrieved later if needed. A good example would be using a vector Database to store semantic meaning of the interactions. 𝟮. Semantic - Any external information that is available to the agent and any knowledge the agent should have about itself. You can think of this as a context similar to one used in RAG applications. It can be internal knowledge only available to the agent or a grounding context to isolate part of the internet scale data for more accurate answers. 𝟯. Procedural - This is systemic information like the structure of the System Prompt, available tools, guardrails etc. It will usually be stored in Git, Prompt and Tool Registries. 𝟰. Occasionally, the agent application would pull information from long-term memory and store it locally if it is needed for the task at hand. 𝟱. All of the information pulled together from the long-term or stored in local memory is called short-term or working memory. Compiling all of it into a prompt will produce the prompt to be passed to the LLM and it will provide further actions to be taken by the system. We usually label 1. - 3. as Long-Term memory and 5. as Short-Term memory. A visual explanation of potential implementation details 👇 And that is it!

Long-term memory helps the agent recall past interactions, store relevant knowledge, and follow defined rules. Short-term memory focuses on pulling together the information needed to handle current tasks. Tools like vector databases and clear instructions make this process smooth.

This approach ensures agents can retrieve historical context efficiently, making interactions more personalized and adaptive. Perfect for applications like customer support or long-term conversational AI. 🧠🔍 2️⃣ Semantic Memory: This type of memory acting as the agent's knowledge base is so crucial. By grounding responses with domain-specific or internal knowledge, agents become far more accurate and reliable, especially in dynamic environments like RAG applications. 🌐📚 3️⃣ Procedural Memory: Your point about defining systemic structures like prompts, tools, and guardrails is spot on. Keeping these elements stored in registries or Git ensures that agents operate consistently while allowing for easy scalability and updates—a must-have for production systems. ⚙️📂 4️⃣ Short-Term/Working Memory: Pulling together relevant long-term memories into context-rich prompts is the cornerstone of enabling agents to respond intelligently. This synthesis ensures agents are not only reactive but also proactive in delivering meaningful actions. 💡✨ The distinction between long-term (episodic, semantic, procedural) and short-term/working memory mirrors human-like cognition beautifully. It highlights how AI agents can mimic natural decision-making processes with the right architecture. Thank you for such an insightful post! This framework makes it easier to design robust, context-aware Agentic AI systems. Excited to see more of your thoughts on implementing these ideas in real-world scenarios! 🙌 [#AgenticAI](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Fagenticai&trk=public_post-text) [#AIAgents](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Faiagents&trk=public_post-text) [#MemoryInAI](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Fmemoryinai&trk=public_post-text) [#LLM](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Fllm&trk=public_post-text) [#AIInnovation](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Faiinnovation&trk=public_post-text) [#MachineLearning](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Fmachinelearning&trk=public_post-text)\n[ ](https://lt.linkedin.com/in/aurimas-griciunas?trk=public_post_reshare_feed-actor-image)\n[ Aurimas Griciūnas ](https://lt.linkedin.com/in/aurimas-griciunas?trk=public_post_reshare_feed-actor-name) Aurimas Griciūnas is an Influencer\nFounder @ SwirlAI • AI Engineer • Follow me to Learn about AI Systems • Author of SwirlAI Newsletter • Public Speaker \n2mo \nA simple way to explain 𝗔𝗜 𝗔𝗴𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝗠𝗲𝗺𝗼𝗿𝘆. In general, the memory for an agent is something that we provide via context in the prompt passed to LLM that helps the agent to better plan and react given past interactions or data not immediately available. It is useful to group the memory into four types: 𝟭. Episodic - This type of memory contains past interactions and actions performed by the agent. After an action is taken, the application controlling the agent would store the action in some kind of persistent storage so that it can be retrieved later if needed. A good example would be using a vector Database to store semantic meaning of the interactions. 𝟮. Semantic - Any external information that is available to the agent and any knowledge the agent should have about itself. You can think of this as a context similar to one used in RAG applications. It can be internal knowledge only available to the agent or a grounding context to isolate part of the internet scale data for more accurate answers. 𝟯. Procedural - This is systemic information like the structure of the System Prompt, available tools, guardrails etc. It will usually be stored in Git, Prompt and Tool Registries. 𝟰. Occasionally, the agent application would pull information from long-term memory and store it locally if it is needed for the task at hand. 𝟱. All of the information pulled together from the long-term or stored in local memory is called short-term or working memory. Compiling all of it into a prompt will produce the prompt to be passed to the LLM and it will provide further actions to be taken by the system. We usually label 1. - 3. as Long-Term memory and 5. as Short-Term memory. A visual explanation of potential implementation details 👇 And that is it!

Building on this, I find it fascinating (and perhaps a bit concerning) how an agent’s memory can enable a logical progression in influencing user actions or decisions over time. For example, if a human prompt includes personal details like “I don’t like exercise” or “I’m stressed at work,” the agent can recall these interactions to guide responses that subtly nudge behavior—tailoring advice to be more actionable and relevant to the user’s preferences and patterns. However, this raises an interesting point about the potential for AI agents to not only assist but influence users in how they think, act, or behave. Over time, as memory grows, (correct me if I’m wrong) these interactions could evolve into a highly personalized feedback loop, encouraging specific actions aligned with the user’s stated goals. Ethical design and user autonomy will play a crucial role in ensuring these agents act as supportive guides rather than directive forces.
