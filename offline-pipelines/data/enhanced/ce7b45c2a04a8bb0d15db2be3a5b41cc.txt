# Sentence Transformers: Embeddings, Retrieval, and Reranking
[](https://github.com/UKPLab/sentence-transformers/#sentence-transformers-embeddings-retrieval-and-reranking)
This framework provides an easy method to compute embeddings for accessing, using, and training state-of-the-art embedding and reranker models. It compute embeddings using Sentence Transformer models ([quickstart](https://sbert.net/docs/quickstart.html#sentence-transformer)) or to calculate similarity scores using Cross-Encoder (a.k.a. reranker) models ([quickstart](https://sbert.net/docs/quickstart.html#cross-encoder)). This unlocks a wide range of applications, including [semantic search](https://sbert.net/examples/applications/semantic-search/README.html), [semantic textual similarity](https://sbert.net/docs/sentence_transformer/usage/semantic_textual_similarity.html), and [paraphrase mining](https://sbert.net/examples/applications/paraphrase-mining/README.html).
A wide selection of over [10,000 pre-trained Sentence Transformers models](https://huggingface.co/models?library=sentence-transformers) are available for immediate use on 🤗 Hugging Face, including many of the state-of-the-art models from the [Massive Text Embeddings Benchmark (MTEB) leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/mteb/leaderboard). Additionally, it is easy to train or finetune your own [embedding models](https://sbert.net/docs/sentence_transformer/training_overview.html) or [reranker models](https://sbert.net/docs/cross_encoder/training_overview.html) using Sentence Transformers, enabling you to create custom models for your specific use cases.
For the **full documentation** , see **[www.SBERT.net](https://www.sbert.net)**.
## Installation
[](https://github.com/UKPLab/sentence-transformers/#installation)
We recommend **Python 3.9+** , **[PyTorch 1.11.0+](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/)** , and **[transformers v4.34.0+](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers)**.
**Install with pip**
```
pip install -U sentence-transformers

```

**Install with conda**
```
conda install -c conda-forge sentence-transformers

```

**Install from sources**
Alternatively, you can also clone the latest version from the [repository](https://github.com/UKPLab/sentence-transformers) and install it directly from the source code:
```
pip install -e .

```

**PyTorch with CUDA**
If you want to use a GPU / CUDA, you must install PyTorch with the matching CUDA Version. Follow [PyTorch - Get Started](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) for further details how to install PyTorch.
## Getting Started
[](https://github.com/UKPLab/sentence-transformers/#getting-started)
See [Quickstart](https://www.sbert.net/docs/quickstart.html) in our documentation.
### Embedding Models
[](https://github.com/UKPLab/sentence-transformers/#embedding-models)
First download a pretrained embedding a.k.a. Sentence Transformer model.
```
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
model = SentenceTransformer("all-MiniLM-L6-v2")
```

Then provide some texts to the model.
```
sentences = [
  "The weather is lovely today.",
  "It's so sunny outside!",
  "He drove to the stadium.",
]
embeddings = model.encode(sentences)
print(embeddings.shape)
# => (3, 384)
```

And that's already it. We now have a numpy arrays with the embeddings, one for each text. We can use these to compute similarities.
```
similarities = model.similarity(embeddings, embeddings)
print(similarities)
# tensor([[1.0000, 0.6660, 0.1046],
#     [0.6660, 1.0000, 0.1411],
#     [0.1046, 0.1411, 1.0000]])
```

### Reranker Models
[](https://github.com/UKPLab/sentence-transformers/#reranker-models)
First download a pretrained reranker a.k.a. Cross Encoder model.
```
from sentence_transformers import CrossEncoder
# 1. Load a pretrained CrossEncoder model
model = CrossEncoder("cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L6-v2")
```

Then provide some texts to the model.
```
# The texts for which to predict similarity scores
query = "How many people live in Berlin?"
passages = [
  "Berlin had a population of 3,520,031 registered inhabitants in an area of 891.82 square kilometers.",
  "Berlin has a yearly total of about 135 million day visitors, making it one of the most-visited cities in the European Union.",
  "In 2013 around 600,000 Berliners were registered in one of the more than 2,300 sport and fitness clubs.",
]
# 2a. predict scores pairs of texts
scores = model.predict([(query, passage) for passage in passages])
print(scores)
# => [8.607139 5.506266 6.352977]
```

And we're good to go. You can also use [`model.rank`](https://sbert.net/docs/package_reference/cross_encoder/cross_encoder.html#sentence_transformers.cross_encoder.CrossEncoder.rank) to avoid having to perform the reranking manually:
```
# 2b. Rank a list of passages for a query
ranks = model.rank(query, passages, return_documents=True)
print("Query:", query)
for rank in ranks:
  print(f"- #{rank['corpus_id']} ({rank['score']:.2f}): {rank['text']}")
"""
Query: How many people live in Berlin?
- #0 (8.61): Berlin had a population of 3,520,031 registered inhabitants in an area of 891.82 square kilometers.
- #2 (6.35): In 2013 around 600,000 Berliners were registered in one of the more than 2,300 sport and fitness clubs.
- #1 (5.51): Berlin has a yearly total of about 135 million day visitors, making it one of the most-visited cities in the European Union.
"""
```

## Pre-Trained Models
[](https://github.com/UKPLab/sentence-transformers/#pre-trained-models)
We provide a large list of pretrained models for more than 100 languages. Some models are general purpose models, while others produce embeddings for specific use cases.
  * [Pretrained Sentence Transformer (Embedding) Models](https://sbert.net/docs/sentence_transformer/pretrained_models.html)
  * [Pretrained Cross Encoder (Reranker) Models](https://sbert.net/docs/cross_encoder/pretrained_models.html)


## Training
[](https://github.com/UKPLab/sentence-transformers/#training)
This framework allows you to fine-tune your own sentence embedding methods, so that you get task-specific sentence embeddings. You have various options to choose from in order to get perfect sentence embeddings for your specific task.
  * Embedding Models 
    * [Sentence Transformer > Training Overview](https://www.sbert.net/docs/sentence_transformer/training_overview.html)
    * [Sentence Transformer > Training Examples](https://www.sbert.net/docs/sentence_transformer/training/examples.html) or [training examples on GitHub](https://github.com/UKPLab/sentence-transformers/tree/master/examples/sentence_transformer/training).
  * Reranker Models 
    * [Cross Encoder > Training Overview](https://www.sbert.net/docs/cross_encoder/training_overview.html)

Some highlights across both types of training are:
  * Support of various transformer networks including BERT, RoBERTa, XLM-R, DistilBERT, Electra, BART, ...
  * Multi-Lingual and multi-task learning
  * Evaluation during training to find optimal model
  * [20+ loss functions](https://www.sbert.net/docs/package_reference/sentence_transformer/losses.html) for embedding models and [10+ loss functions](https://www.sbert.net/docs/package_reference/cross_encoder/losses.html) for reranker models, allowing you to tune models specifically for semantic search, paraphrase mining, semantic similarity comparison, clustering, triplet loss, contrastive loss, etc.
