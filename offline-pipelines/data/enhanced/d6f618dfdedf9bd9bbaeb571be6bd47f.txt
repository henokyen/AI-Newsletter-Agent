# Machine Learning Operations
With Machine Learning Model Operationalization Management (MLOps), we want to provide an end-to-end machine learning development process to design, build and manage reproducible, testable, and evolvable ML-powered software.

## Getting started
Being an emerging field, MLOps is rapidly gaining momentum amongst Data Scientists, ML Engineers and AI enthusiasts. Following this trend, the [Continuous Delivery Foundation SIG MLOps](https://github.com/cdfoundation/sig-mlops) differentiates the ML models management from traditional software engineering and suggests the following MLOps capabilities:
  * MLOps aims to unify the release cycle for machine learning and software application release. 
  * MLOps enables automated testing of machine learning artifacts (e.g. data validation, ML model testing, and ML model integration testing) 
  * MLOps enables the application of agile principles to machine learning projects.
  * MLOps enables supporting machine learning models and datasets to build these models as first-class citizens within CI/CD systems. 
  * MLOps reduces technical debt across machine learning models.
  * MLOps must be a language-, framework-, platform-, and infrastructure-agnostic practice.

### Motivation for MLOps
You will learn for what to use Machine Learning, about various scenarios of change that need to be managed and the iterative nature of ML-based software development. Finally, we provide the MLOps definition and show the evolution of MLOps.

### Designing ML-powered Software
This part is devoted to one of the most important phase in any software project — understanding the business problem and requirements. As these equally apply to ML-based software you need to make sure to have a good understanding before setting out designing things.

### Three Levels of ML-based Software
You will learn about three core elements of ML-based software — Data, ML models, and Code. In particular, we will talk about
  * Data Engineering Pipelines
  * ML Pipelines and ML workflows.
  * Model Serving Patterns and Deployment Strategies
