They’re promising prototypes, but they never go live!\nThe culprit is almost always the retrieval. Come on, this is the heart of RAGs. What are we supposed to build without this?\nThis is until I **index documents** for faster or better retrieval.\nIndexing helps us engineer solutions that retrieve data faster. It significantly reduces latency, improving the overall app experience. We use indexing in almost every app we build. It has nothing to do with LLMs or RAGs.\nAlmost all the databases ship with indexing support. For instance, [Postgres](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/postgresql-indexing-strategies/) can do _B-Tree, GiST, SP-GiST, BRIN, GIN, and Hash_ types of indexing. That’s a list long enough to go to a separate future post.\nIn this post, I’ll discuss the popular indexing strategies I frequently use for better document retrieval. These techniques are, however, specific to RAG apps. You’ll see why in a moment.\nMy two go-to indexing techniques are **multi-representation and ColBERT**. These aren’t the only methods we have. And it’s an evolving sub-field in RAGs.\nIf there are many, why do I prefer these two over any other? There are two main reasons.\n> They are both easy to understand and implement\n> But they also do well in most instances\nYou’ll also see that indexing improves speed and helps retrieve more relevant documents, especially ColBERT, compared to a system without indexing.\nReal quick—before moving on, you should know **how to chunk large documents** into smaller pieces for embedding and retrieval. Whenever I say document, I mean these chunks. As always, we have more than one method for chunking documents. Your job as an engineer is to pick the best for your case.\nI’ve discussed these in my previous posts. Take a moment to check [position-based churning vs. semantic chunking](https://towardsdatascience.com/semantic-chunking-for-rag-35b7675ffafd) and [agentic chunking](https://towardsdatascience.com/agentic-chunking-for-rags-091beccd94b1). I even tried [clustering as a cheap and fast alternative for agentic chunking](https://towardsdatascience.com/improving-rag-chunking-with-clustering-03c1cf41f1cd).\n## Multi-representation: Faster and reasonably accurate\nThe name speaks for itself. ryte?\nWe store two versions of our documents – One for indexing. But the other is the actual document that we retrieve.\nSimple!\nOnce we chunk our documents, we create a version optimized for retrieval. This would usually be a summary of the original chunk, which should contain all the vital information.\nWe store the **optimized version in a vector store** and the **original chunk in a document store**. We bind them both with the **same key** to trace which optimized version is for which document.\nNow, we retrieve as usual. We ask the vector store to fetch the documents closer to our text input in the vector space. But as we retrieve, we use the key we set before to fetch the original document instead of the optimized version.\nHere’s a code walkthrough.\n```\n# Multi-Representation Indexing Tutorial\n## 1. Import required libraries and load environment variables\nimport uuid\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\nfrom langchain_community.document_loaders import WebBaseLoader\nfrom langchain_text_splitters import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter\nfrom langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate\nfrom langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI, OpenAIEmbeddings\nfrom langchain_core.output_parsers import StrOutputParser\nfrom langchain.storage import InMemoryByteStore\nfrom langchain.vectorstores import Chroma\nfrom langchain.retrievers.multi_vector import MultiVectorRetriever\nfrom langchain_core.documents import Document\n# Load environment variables (e.g., API keys)\nload_dotenv()\n## 2. Load and preprocess the document\n# Load the document from a web page. We use Django's security page as an example\nloader = WebBaseLoader(\"https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/topics/security/\")\ndocs = loader.load()\n# Split the document into smaller chunks\ntext_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=500, chunk_overlap=100)\nchunks = text_splitter.split_documents(docs)\n## 3. Generate optimized summaries for each chunk\n# Set up the language model and prompt\nmodel = ChatOpenAI()\ntemplate = \"\"\"\nGenerate a concise and coherent summary of the following document, ensuring that all key details, important concepts, and relevant information are preserved. \nHighlight the main points and conclusions while maintaining clarity and context.\n{document}\n\"\"\"\nprompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template(template)\noutput_parser = StrOutputParser()\n# Create a chain for summarization\nchain = prompt | model | output_parser\n# Generate optimized summaries for each chunk\noptimized_chunks = chain.batch(chunks)\n## 4. Set up the multi-vector retriever\n# Initialize vector store and document store\nvectorstore = Chroma(embedding_function=OpenAIEmbeddings())\ndocumentstore = InMemoryByteStore()\n# Generate unique keys for each chunk\nkey = \"unique_id\"\nkeys = [str(uuid.uuid4()) for _ in range(len(optimized_chunks))]\n# Create Document objects with metadata\ndocs = [\n  Document(page_content=chunk, metadata={key: keys[ix]})\n  for ix, chunk in enumerate(optimized_chunks)\n]\n# Set up the multi-vector retriever\nretriever = MultiVectorRetriever(\n  vectorstore=vectorstore,\n  byte_store=documentstore,\n  id_key=key,\n)\n## 5. Add documents to the retriever\n# Add documents to the vector store\nretriever.vectorstore.add_documents(docs)\n# Add documents to the document store\nretriever.docstore.mset(\n  list(zip(keys, [Document(page_content=d) for d in optimized_chunks]))\n)\n## 6. Retrieve relevant documents\n# Example query\nquery = \"How to restrict access to certain hosts?\"\nrelevant_docs = retriever.get_relevant_documents(query)\n# Print the retrieved documents\nfor doc in relevant_docs:\n  print(f\"Content: {doc.page_content}n\")\n  print(f\"Metadata: {doc.metadata}n\")\n  print(\"---n\")\n```\n\nIf we ignore the library loading part, five key steps are involved. Let’s look at them in detail.\n![Multi-representation - Image by the author](https://towardsdatascience.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/1syORwpSl-Nq6C_jGdK0nVw.png)Multi-representation – Image by the author\nFirstly, we load our sources. Then we chunk them.\nI’ve used recursive character splitting here, but I do not like position-based chunking. I use it here for simplicity’s sake.\nThen, we create an LLM chain to summarize our original chunks. The summaries we create should have all the essential details. This is the crucial part of multi-representation indexing. Although I’ve given a short prompt, you should spend most of your time here.\nBetter prompts make better summaries. But they also get you the best documents retrieved.\nNote that we use the batch function to convert all the chunks into summaries in one go. This comes in handy for large datasets.\nIn steps 4 and 5, we create a MultiVectorRetriever. Essentially, this is the multi-representation indexing process. You create a retriever aware of your vector store and the document store and how the optimized vector versions relate to the documents in the document store. That’s the document key.\nNow, we’re ready to run queries and retrieve documents. Here’s the output we get.\n```\nContent: Django now requires setting ALLOWED_HOSTS explicitly to enhance security, even when using a virtual host with ServerName configured. This change prevents potential security vulnerabilities from fake Host headers in HTTP requests. It is recommended to update Django configurations accordingly to mitigate risks effectively. Source: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/topics/security/\nMetadata: {}\n---\n```\n```\nMetadata: {}\n```\n```\n---\n```\n\nThis is the original chunk from the website. However, we only have the optimized version in the vector store for retrieval.\n### How does it get more relevant documents?\nYou might ask, \"Okay, this may improve performance, but how does it help retrieve more relevant documents?\"\nHere’s how.\nA large chunk of text mainly contains noise. That’s less relevant information to the main point. The cosine similarity, or any other distance-based similarity search, goes wrong with this noise.\nBy only including the necessary details in the chunk, we reduce the noise to a greater extent. Now, similarity searches only have to worry about ‘similarity,’ not the noise.\n## ColBERT: When accuracy matters more than speed\nThe idea behind ColBERT is complex—at least to my immature mind—but not too complicated to grasp.\nBut here’s the need for a different approach.\nThe chunk and the query are embedded into vector forms in regular retrieval. Then, a similarity search is performed to find the nearest neighbors.\nThis approach is straightforward – but has an issue.\nDocuments are often comparatively larger. Queries are not. The comparison is not apple-to-apple.\nColBERT handles it in a slightly different way. Here’s a diagram that illustrates it.\n![ColBERT indexing for RAG - Image by the Author](https://towardsdatascience.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/1SCa4padRDYHGreB1F3ejoA.png)ColBERT indexing for RAG – Image by the Author\nWe take chunks one by one and tokenize them. We do the same for our search query.\nThen, we compute the similarities between every token in the search query and the tokens in the chunk. We then take the maximum and keep a note of it.\nWe do this process for every token in our search query. Now, you’ve got an array of maximum similarity scores. Each number in this represents a token in the chunk. You take the sum of this array. Now you’ve got a single score for a chunk.\nOkay, we need to do this for all the chunks in the vector store. Now, we’ve got an array of similarity values. This time, each number in the array represents a document.\nLastly, you can compare the values you’ve computed for all the chunks to find the most similar chunks.\nThat’s a lot of work.\nI know what you’re thinking.\n> If it’s complex, why would you still pick it as your first choice?\nThe credit goes to a library called \"[RAGatouille](https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/integrations/retrievers/ragatouille/)\" (Not [Ratatouille](https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/integrations/retrievers/ragatouille/) 🐀 .), making ColBERT implementation effortless.\nHere’s how.\nLet’s first install RAGatouille using Pypi.\n```\n!pip install ragatouille\n```\n\nIf you do it on your local computer, you’ll need to download many files and wait a long time. You’re lucky if you do it on a Colab notebook or a cloud resource.\nWe have to import the pre-trained model for ColBERT. The following lines would do.\n```\nfrom ragatouille import RAGPretrainedModel\nRAG = RAGPretrainedModel.from_pretrained(\"colbert-ir/colbertv2.0\")\n```\n![Image by the Author](https://towardsdatascience.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/17etb3NuPdd7yW7pJN5rYIQ.png)Image by the Author\nWe’re now ready to index and retrieve using the ColBERT model. But let’s fetch and prepare our text for this. We’ll use the same [Django security documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/topics/security/) for this purpose.\n```\nPython\">import requests\nfrom bs4 import BeautifulSoup, SoupStrainer\nurl = \"https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/topics/security/\"\nonly_content = SoupStrainer(id=\"docs-content\")\nsoup = BeautifulSoup(requests.get(url).content, \"html.parser\", parse_only=only_content)\nfull_document = soup.get_text(separator='n', strip=True)\nfull_document\n```\n![Image by the Author](https://towardsdatascience.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/1NGqn-FFH4SFhRXaYiBRlMw.png)Image by the Author\nHere’s the magical part. Indexing with RAGatouille is just a single line. Retrieval is another.\n```\nRAG.index(\n  collection=[full_document],\n  index_name=\"Djagno-security\",\n  max_document_length=180,\n  split_documents=True,\n)\n```\n\nThis step is going to take a lot of time. ColBERT isn’t good at speed. We will come to that later.\nThe point here is that it’s now simple to implement. It is simpler than the other methods.\nAnd here’s how the retrieval step goes.\n```\nresults = RAG.search(query=\"How to restrict access based on host names?\", k=3)\nresults\n```\n![Image by the Author](https://towardsdatascience.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/1GIO9G9_XCNxOmS-Gczk0MQ.png)Image by the Author\nThe first time you run a query against your documents, it will take a lot of time. This is because RAGatouille fetches and indexes the document simultaneously.\nDon’t be alarmed!\nYour subsequent queries will take little time, and you will get more accurate document chunks with reasonably low latency.\n### The big caveat of ColBERT\nI love ColBERT just as much as I hate it.\nEven though ColBERT is excellent at retrieving relevant information, it has a high computing cost and indexing time.\nIf you’ve followed this post, you’d have already noticed it takes a lot of time to index even a tiny web page. Imagine if you’re indexing all the documents an organization that has lived for a couple of decades has produced.\nYou’ll need a giant computer, or your vacations will be canceled.\nI haven’t used ColBERT for any of the projects because of this, but it’s still in all my prototypes.\n## Final thoughts\nYou can build an RAG app overnight, and the following day, you can put it live.\nYet, without making critical decisions, the app won’t survive in production for various reasons. Often, the complaints are latency and inaccuracy.\nThis is almost always the retrieval or communication with the LLMs phases for RAG apps.\nIn this post, I’ve shared some fantastic techniques I learned that helped me reduce retrieval-related issues.\nI hope it helps you too.\n_Thanks for reading, friend!
