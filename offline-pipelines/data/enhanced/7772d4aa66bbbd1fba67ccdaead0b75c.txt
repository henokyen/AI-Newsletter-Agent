* service: only shutdown if process not terminated
There are scenarios where a stop\(\) is called on a Service object
multiple times. This also happens when explicitly quitting a Webdriver using
driver.quit\(\) and afterwards having the garbage collector destroy the service
object, calling stop\(\) another time even though the service process
has already terminated.
The check inside the stop\(\) call only ensured that the process variable
is not None, but ignored the fact that the process might already have
terminated. Therefor an additional check is introduced to only send
the remote shutdown command if the service process has not ended.

[.editorconfig](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/blob/trunk/.editorconfig ".editorconfig")| [.editorconfig](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/blob/trunk/.editorconfig ".editorconfig")| [[rb] Split `rb/BUILD` into smaller packages](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/commit/29949525e37b36c9954285cfc500615c760d500e "\[rb\] Split `rb/BUILD` into smaller packages
This fits more into Bazel approach because smaller packages with a
proper dependency tree would allow to use Bazel caching more
efficiently. For example, only few tests would be re-run considering
you ran all integration tests for Chrome before and only changed code
in `chrome/driver.rb`. This is because just a few tests depend on
`chrome/driver.rb`. Per-test file packages also allow us to use Bazel
flaky retry flags efficiently - previously it would re-run all the tests
when one of them fails.
This commit also moves certain files around to make Ruby codebase more
reasonable:
* CDP client code generator lives in the `rb/lib/selenium/devtools`
* Nightly version generator lives in a new `rb/lib/selenium/support`
Since now integration tests are being in parallel by default, few
changes had to be done to make support code more concurrency-safe.
Notably, Grid and Rack servers are being started on randomized ports.
Some other tests were adapted/guarded to work better when run in
parallel.
The test configuration is now controlled by a combination of
`--define <name>=<value>` flags, supporting `browser/remote/headless` as
names. See README.md changes for more details.")| Jan 12, 2023

Selenium is an umbrella project encapsulating a variety of tools and libraries enabling web browser automation. Selenium specifically provides an infrastructure for the [W3C WebDriver specification](https://w3c.github.io/webdriver/) — a platform and language-neutral coding interface compatible with all major web browsers.
The project is made possible by volunteer contributors who've generously donated thousands of hours in code development and upkeep.
This README is for developers interested in contributing to the project. For people looking to get started using Selenium, please check out our [User Manual](https://selenium.dev/documentation/) for detailed examples and descriptions, and if you get stuck, there are several ways to [Get Help](https://www.selenium.dev/support/).

## Contributing
[](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/#contributing)
Please read [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/blob/trunk/CONTRIBUTING.md) before submitting your pull requests.
## Installing
[](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/#installing)
These are the requirements to create your own local dev environment to contribute to Selenium.
### All Platforms
[](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/#all-platforms)
  * [Bazelisk](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazelisk), a Bazel wrapper that automatically downloads the version of Bazel specified in `.bazelversion` file and transparently passes through all command-line arguments to the real Bazel binary.
  * Java JDK version 17 or greater (e.g., [Java 17 Temurin](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/?version=17)) 
    * Set `JAVA_HOME` environment variable to location of Java executable (the JDK not the JRE)
    * To test this, try running the command `javac`. This command won't exist if you only have the JRE installed. If you're met with a list of command-line options, you're referencing the JDK properly.


### MacOS
[](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/#macos)
  * Xcode including the command-line tools. Install the latest version using: `xcode-select --install`
  * Rosetta for Apple Silicon Macs. Add `build --host_platform=//:rosetta` to the `.bazelrc.local` file. We are working to make sure this isn't required in the long run.


### Windows
[](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/#windows)
Several years ago [Jim Evans](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jimevansmusic/) published a great article on [Setting Up a Windows Development Environment for the Selenium .NET Language Bindings](https://jimevansmusic.blogspot.com/2020/04/setting-up-windows-development.html); This article is out of date, but it includes more detailed descriptions and screenshots that some people might find useful.
Click to see Current Windows Setup Requirements
#### Option 1: Automatic Installation from Scratch
[](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/#option-1-automatic-installation-from-scratch)
This script will ensure a complete ready to execute developer environment. (nothing is installed or set that is already present unless otherwise prompted)
  1. Open Powershell as an Administrator
  2. Execute: `Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force` to allow running the script in the process
  3. Navigate to the directory you want to clone Selenium in, or the parent directory of an already cloned Selenium repo
  4. Download and execute this script in the powershell terminal: [scripts/dev-environment-setup.ps1]`


#### Option 2: Manual Installation
[](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/#option-2-manual-installation)
  1. Allow running scripts in Selenium in general: 
```
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned

```

  2. Enable Developer Mode: 
```
reg add "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\AppModelUnlock" /t REG_DWORD /f /v "AllowDevelopmentWithoutDevLicense" /d "1"

```

  3. Install [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/), which is an alternative shell environment that provides Unix-like commands 
     * Add bin directory to `PATH` environment variable (e.g., `"C:\tools\msys64\usr\bin"`)
     * Add `bash.exe` location as the `BAZEL_SH` environment variable (e.g., `"C:\tools\msys64\usr\bin\bash.exe"`)
  4. Install the latest version of [Visual Studio Community](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/)
     * Use the visual studio installer to modify and add the "Desktop development with C++" Workload
     * Add Visual C++ build tools installation directory location to `BAZEL_VC` environment variable (e.g. `"C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Community\VC"`)
     * Add Visual C++ Build tools version to `BAZEL_VC_FULL_VERSION` environment variable (this can be discovered from the directory name in `"$BAZEL_VC\Tools\MSVC\<BAZEL_VC_FULL_VERSION>"`)
  5. Add support for long file names (bazel has a lot of nested directories that can exceed default limits in Windows) 
     * Enable Long Paths support with these 2 registry commands:
```
reg add "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Command Processor" /t REG_DWORD /f /v "DisableUNCCheck" /d "1"
reg add "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\FileSystem" /t REG_DWORD /f /v "LongPathsEnabled" /d "1"
```

     * Allow Bazel to create short name versions of long file paths: `fsutil 8dot3name set 0`
     * Set bazel output to `C:/tmp` instead of nested inside project directory: 
       * Create a file `selenium/.bazelrc.windows.local`
       * Add "startup --output_user_root=C:/tmp" to the file


### Alternative Dev Environments
[](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/#alternative-dev-environments)
If you want to contribute to the project, but do not want to set up your own local dev environment, there are two alternatives available.
#### Using GitPod
[](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/#using-gitpod)
Rather than creating your own local dev environment, GitPod provides a ready to use environment for you.
[![Open in Gitpod](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/b04f5659467d23b5109ba935a40c00decd264eea25c22d50a118021349eea94f/68747470733a2f2f676974706f642e696f2f627574746f6e2f6f70656e2d696e2d676974706f642e737667)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium)
#### Using Dev Container
[](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/#using-dev-container)
As an alternative you can build a [Dev Container](https://containers.dev/) - basically a docker container - suitable for building and testing Selenium using the devcontainer.json in the [.devcontainer](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/blob/trunk/.devcontainer/devcontainer.json) directory. Supporting IDEs like VS Code or IntelliJ IDEA should point you to how such a container can be created.
#### Using Docker Image
[](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/#using-docker-image)
You can also build a Docker image suitable for building and testing Selenium using the Dockerfile in the [dev image](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/blob/trunk/scripts/dev-image/Dockerfile) directory.
## Building
[](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/#building)
Selenium is built using a common build tool called [Bazel](https://bazel.build/), to allow us to easily manage dependency downloads, generate required binaries, build and release packages, and execute tests; all in a fast, efficient manner. For a more detailed discussion, read Simon Stewart's article on [Building Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2023/building-selenium/)
Often we wrap Bazel commands with our custom [Rake](http://rake.rubyforge.org/) wrapper. These are run with the `./go` command.
The common Bazel commands are:
  * `bazel build` — evaluates dependencies, compiles source files and generates output files for the specified target. It's used to create executable binaries, libraries, or other artifacts.
  * `bazel run` — builds the target and then executes it. It's typically used for targets that produce executable binaries.
  * `bazel test` — builds and runs the target in a context with additional testing functionality
  * `bazel query` — identifies available targets for the provided path.


Each module that can be built is defined in a `BUILD.bazel` file. To execute the module you refer to it starting with a `//`, then include the relative path to the file that defines it, then `:`, then the name of the target. For example, the target to build the Grid is named `executable-grid` and it is defined in the `'selenium/java/src/org/openqa/selenium/grid/BAZEL.build'` file. So to build the grid you would run: `bazel build //java/src/org/openqa/selenium/grid:executable-grid`.
The Bazel documentation has a [handy guide](https://bazel.build/run/build#specifying-build-targets) for various shortcuts and all the ways to build multiple targets, which Selenium makes frequent use of.
To build everything for a given language:
```
bazel build //<language>/...
```

To build just the grid there is an alias name to use (the log will show where the output jar is located):
```
bazel build grid
```

To make things more simple, building each of the bindings is available with this `./go` command
```
./go <language>:build
```

## Developing
[](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/#developing)
### Java
[](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/#java)
#### IntelliJ
[](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/#intellij)
Most of the team uses Intellij for their day-to-day editing. If you're working in IntelliJ, then we highly recommend installing the [Bazel IJ plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/8609-bazel) which is documented on [its own site](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/8609-bazel).
To use Selenium with the IntelliJ Bazel plugin, import the repository as a Bazel project, and select the project view file from the [scripts](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/blob/trunk/scripts) directory. `ij.bazelproject` for Mac/Linux and `ij-win.bazelproject` for Windows.
#### Linting
[](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/#linting)
We also use Google Java Format for linting, so using the Google Java Formatter Plugin is useful; there are a few steps to get it working, so read their [configuration documentation](https://github.com/google/google-java-format/blob/master/README.md#intellij-jre-config). There is also an auto-formatting script that can be run: `./scripts/format.sh`
#### Local Installation
[](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/#local-installation)
While Selenium is not built with Maven, you can build and install the Selenium pieces for Maven to use locally by deploying to your local maven repository (`~/.m2/repository`), using:
```
./go java:install
```

#### Updating Dependencies
[](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/#updating-dependencies)
Dependencies are defined in the file [MODULE.bazel](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/blob/trunk/MODULE.bazel). To automatically update and pin new dependencies, run:
```
./go java:update
```

### Python
[](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/#python)
#### Linting
[](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/#linting-1)
We follow the [PEP8 Style Guide for Python Code](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008) (except we use a 120 character line length). This is checked and enforced with several linting tools, including [black](https://pypi.org/project/black), [docformatter](https://pypi.org/project/docformatter), [flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org), and [isort](https://pycqa.github.io/isort).
To run all of the linting tools:
```
./go py:lint
```

You need `tox` installed to run the linting tools (`pip install tox`).
#### Local Installation
[](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/#local-installation-1)
To run Python code locally without building/installing the package, you must first install the dependencies:
```
pip install -r py/requirements.txt
```

Then, build the generated files and copy them into your local source tree:
```
./go py:local_dev
```

After that, you can import the selenium package directly from source from the `py` directory.
Instead of running from source, you can build and install the selenium package (wheel) locally:
```
./go py:install
```

This will attempt to install into the global Python `site-packages` directory, which might not be writable. To avoid this, you should create and activate a [virtual environment](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/installing-packages/#creating-virtual-environments) before installing.
### Ruby
[](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/#ruby)
Instead of using `irb`, you can create an interactive REPL with all gems loaded using: `bazel run //rb:console`
If you want to debug code, you can do it via [`debug`](https://github.com/ruby/debug) gem:
  1. Add `binding.break` to the code where you want the debugger to start.
  2. Run tests with `ruby_debug` configuration: `bazel test --config ruby_debug <test>`.
  3. When debugger starts, run the following in a separate terminal to connect to debugger:


```
bazel-selenium/external/bundle/bin/rdbg -A
```

If you want to use [RubyMine](https://www.jetbrains.com/ruby/) for development, you can configure it use Bazel artifacts:
  1. Open `rb/` as a main project directory.
  2. Run `bundle exec rake update` as necessary to create up-to-date artifacts. If this does not work, run `./go rb:update` from the `selenium` (parent) directory.
  3. In `Settings / Languages & Frameworks / Ruby SDK and Gems` add new `Interpreter` pointing to `../bazel-selenium/external/rules_ruby_dist/dist/bin/ruby`.
  4. You should now be able to run and debug any spec. It uses Chrome by default, but you can alter it using environment variables secified in [Ruby Testing](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/#ruby-2) section below.


### Rust
[](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/#rust)
To keep `Carbo.Bazel.lock` synchronized with `Cargo.lock`, run:
```
CARGO_BAZEL_REPIN=true bazel sync --only=crates
```

## Testing
[](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/#testing)
There are a number of bazel configurations specific for testing.
### Common Options Examples
[](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/#common-options-examples)
Here are examples of arguments we make use of in testing the Selenium code:
  * `--pin_browsers` - run specific browser versions defined in the build (versions are updated regularly)
  * `--headless` - run browsers in headless mode (supported be Chrome, Edge and Firefox)
  * `--flaky_test_attempts 3` - re-run failed tests up to 3 times
  * `--local_test_jobs 1` - control parallelism of tests
  * `--cache_test_results=no`, `-t-` - disable caching of test results and re-runs all of them
  * `--test_output all` - print all output from the tests, not just errors
  * `--test_output streamed` - run all tests one by one and print its output immediately
  * `--test_env FOO=bar` - pass extra environment variable to test process
  * `--run_under="xvfb-run -a"` - prefix to insert before the execution


### Filtering
[](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/#filtering)
Selenium tests can be filtered by size:
  * small — typically unit tests where no browser is opened
  * large — typically tests that actually drive a browser
  * medium — tests that are more involved than simple unit tests, but not fully driving a browser


These can be filtered using the `test_size_filters` argument like this:
```
bazel test //<language>/... --test_size_filters=small
```

Tests can also be filtered by tag like:
```
bazel test //<language>/... --test_tag_filters=this,-not-this
```

If there are multiple `--test_tag_filters`, only the last one is considered, so be careful if also using an inherited config
### Java
[](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/#java-1)
Click to see Java Test Commands
To run unit tests:
```
bazel test //java/... --test_size_filters=small

```

### .NET
[](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/#net)
Click to see .NET Test Commands
.NET tests currently only work with pinned browsers, so make sure to include that.
Run all tests with:
```
bazel test //dotnet/test/common:AllTests --pin_browsers=true
```

You can run specific tests by specifying the class name:
```
bazel test //dotnet/test/common:ElementFindingTest --pin_browsers=true
```

If the module supports multiple browsers:
```
bazel test //dotnet/test/common:ElementFindingTest-edge --pin_browsers=true
```

### Rust
[](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/#rust-1)
Click to see Rust Test Commands
Rust tests are run with:
```
bazel test //rust/...
```

### Linux
[](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/#linux)
Click to see Linux Testing Requirements
By default, Bazel runs these tests in your current X-server UI. If you prefer, you can alternatively run them in a virtual or nested X-server.
  1. Run the X server `Xvfb :99` or `Xnest :99`
  2. Run a window manager, for example, `DISPLAY=:99 jwm`
  3. Run the tests you are interested in:


```
bazel test --test_env=DISPLAY=:99 //java/... --test_tag_filters=chrome
```

An easy way to run tests in a virtual X-server is to use Bazel's `--run_under` functionality:
```
bazel test --run_under="xvfb-run -a" //java/...

```

## Releasing
[](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/#releasing)
The full process for doing a release can be found in [the wiki](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/wiki/Releasing-Selenium)
Releasing is a combination of building and publishing, which often requires coordination of multiple executions and additional processing. As discussed in the [Building](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/#building) section, we use Rake tasks with the `./go` command for these things. These `./go` commands include the `--stamp` argument to provide necessary information about the constructed asset.
You can build and release everything with:
```
./go all:release
```

To build and release a specific language:
```
./go <language>:release
```

If you have access to the Selenium EngFlow repository, you can have the assets built remotely and downloaded locally using:
```
./go all:release['--config', 'release']
```
