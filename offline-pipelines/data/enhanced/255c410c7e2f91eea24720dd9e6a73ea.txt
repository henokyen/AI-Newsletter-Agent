# $ click_
[](https://github.com/pallets/click/#-click_)
Click is a Python package for creating beautiful command line interfaces in a composable way with as little code as necessary. It's the "Command Line Interface Creation Kit". It's highly configurable but comes with sensible defaults out of the box.
It aims to make the process of writing command line tools quick and fun while also preventing any frustration caused by the inability to implement an intended CLI API.
Click in three points:
  * Arbitrary nesting of commands
  * Automatic help page generation
  * Supports lazy loading of subcommands at runtime


## A Simple Example
[](https://github.com/pallets/click/#a-simple-example)
```
import click
@click.command()
@click.option("--count", default=1, help="Number of greetings.")
@click.option("--name", prompt="Your name", help="The person to greet.")
def hello(count, name):
  """Simple program that greets NAME for a total of COUNT times."""
  for _ in range(count):
    click.echo(f"Hello, {name}!")
if __name__ == '__main__':
  hello()
```

```
$ python hello.py --count=3
Your name: Click
Hello, Click!
Hello, Click!
Hello, Click!

```
