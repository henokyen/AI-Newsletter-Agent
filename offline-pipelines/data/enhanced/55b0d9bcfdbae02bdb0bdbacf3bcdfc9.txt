# PiPPy: Pipeline Parallelism for PyTorch
[](https://github.com/pytorch/PiPPy/#pippy-pipeline-parallelism-for-pytorch)
Note
PiPPy has been migrated into [PyTorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch) as a subpackage: [`torch.distributed.pipelining`](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/tree/main/torch/distributed/pipelining). You can find the detailed documentation [here](https://pytorch.org/docs/main/distributed.pipelining.html). The current repo mainly serves as a land of [examples](https://github.com/pytorch/PiPPy/blob/main/examples). The PiPPy library code will be removed. Please use the APIs in `torch.distributed.pipelining` instead. Thank you!

# Why PiPPy?
[](https://github.com/pytorch/PiPPy/#why-pippy)
One of the most important techniques for advancing the state of the art in deep learning is scaling. Common techniques for scaling neural networks include _data parallelism_ , _tensor/operation parallelism_ , and _pipeline parallelism_. In many cases, pipeline parallelism in particular can be an effective technique for scaling, however it is often difficult to implement, requiring intrusive code changes to model code and difficult-to-implement runtime orchestration code. PiPPy aims to provide a toolkit that does said things automatically to allow high-productivity scaling of models.
# What is PiPPy?
[](https://github.com/pytorch/PiPPy/#what-is-pippy)
The PiPPy project consists of a compiler and runtime stack for automated parallelism and scaling of PyTorch models. Currently, PiPPy focuses on _pipeline parallelism_ , a technique in which the code of the model is partitioned and multiple _micro-batches_ execute different parts of the model code concurrently. To learn more about pipeline parallelism, see [this article](https://www.deepspeed.ai/tutorials/pipeline/).

Figure: Pipeline parallel. "F", "B" and "U" denote forward, backward and weight update, respectively. Different colors represent different micro-batches.
PiPPy provides the following features that make pipeline parallelism easier:
  * Automatic splitting of model code by tracing the model. The goal is for the user to provide model code as-is to the system for parallelization, without having to make heavyweight modifications to make parallelism work.
  * Related to the last point, PiPPy supports non-trivial topologies, including skip connections and tied weights/layers. PiPPy provides configurable behavior for tied weights, allowing for transmission across pipeline stages or replication and gradient synchronization.
  * First-class support for cross-host pipeline parallelism, as this is where PP is typically used (over slower interconnects). This is currently missing from the torchgpipe-based `torch.distributed.pipeline.sync.Pipe`.
  * Composability with other parallelism schemes such as data parallelism or tensor splitting model parallelism (overall, known as "3d parallelism"). Currently, pipelining and data parallelism can be composed. Other compositions will be available in the future.
  * Support for pipeline scheduling paradigms, including schedules like fill-drain (GPipe), 1F1B and interleaved 1F1B. More schedules will be added too.

[](https://github.com/pytorch/PiPPy/#examples)
In this repo, we provide rich examples based on realistic models. In particular, we show how to apply PiPPy without any code change to the model. Please refer to the [HuggingFace examples directory](https://github.com/pytorch/PiPPy/blob/main/examples/huggingface). Examples include: [BERT](https://github.com/pytorch/PiPPy/blob/main/examples/huggingface/pippy_bert.py), [GPT2](https://github.com/pytorch/PiPPy/blob/main/examples/huggingface/pippy_gpt2.py), [T5](https://github.com/pytorch/PiPPy/blob/main/examples/huggingface/pippy_t5.py), [LLaMA](https://github.com/pytorch/PiPPy/blob/main/examples/llama), etc.
# PiPPy Explained
[](https://github.com/pytorch/PiPPy/#pippy-explained)
PiPPy consists of two parts: a _compiler_ and a _runtime_. The compiler takes your model code, splits it up, and transforms it into a `Pipe`, which is a wrapper that describes the model at each pipeline stage and their data-flow relationship. The runtime executes the `PipelineStage`s in parallel, handling things like micro-batch splitting, scheduling, communication, and gradient propagation, etc. We will cover the APIs for these concepts in this section.
## Splitting a Model with Pipe
[](https://github.com/pytorch/PiPPy/#splitting-a-model-with-pipe)
To see how we can split a model into a pipeline, let's first take an example trivial neural network:
```
import torch
class MyNetworkBlock(torch.nn.Module):
  def __init__(self, in_dim, out_dim):
    super().__init__()
    self.lin = torch.nn.Linear(in_dim, out_dim)
  def forward(self, x):
    x = self.lin(x)
    x = torch.relu(x)
    return x

class MyNetwork(torch.nn.Module):
  def __init__(self, in_dim, layer_dims):
    super().__init__()
    prev_dim = in_dim
    for i, dim in enumerate(layer_dims):
      setattr(self, f'layer{i}', MyNetworkBlock(prev_dim, dim))
      prev_dim = dim
    self.num_layers = len(layer_dims)
    # 10 output classes
    self.output_proj = torch.nn.Linear(layer_dims[-1], 10)
  def forward(self, x):
    for i in range(self.num_layers):
      x = getattr(self, f'layer{i}')(x)
    return self.output_proj(x)

in_dim = 512
layer_dims = [512, 1024, 256]
mn = MyNetwork(in_dim, layer_dims).to(device)
```

This network is written as free-form Python code; it has not been modified for any specific parallelism technique.
Let us see our first usage of the `pippy.Pipe` interface:
```
from pippy import pipeline, annotate_split_points, Pipe, SplitPoint
annotate_split_points(mn, {'layer0': SplitPoint.END,
              'layer1': SplitPoint.END})
batch_size = 32
example_input = torch.randn(batch_size, in_dim, device=device)
chunks = 4
pipe = pipeline(mn, chunks, example_args=(example_input,))
print(pipe)
"""
************************************* pipe *************************************
GraphModule(
 (submod_0): PipeStageModule(
  (L__self___layer0_mod_lin): Linear(in_features=512, out_features=512, bias=True)
 )
 (submod_1): PipeStageModule(
  (L__self___layer1_mod_lin): Linear(in_features=512, out_features=1024, bias=True)
 )
 (submod_2): PipeStageModule(
  (L__self___layer2_lin): Linear(in_features=1024, out_features=256, bias=True)
  (L__self___output_proj): Linear(in_features=256, out_features=10, bias=True)
 )
)
def forward(self, arg0):
  submod_0 = self.submod_0(arg0); arg0 = None
  submod_1 = self.submod_1(submod_0); submod_0 = None
  submod_2 = self.submod_2(submod_1); submod_1 = None
  return [submod_2]
"""
```

So what's going on here? First, `pipeline` turns our model into a directed acyclic graph (DAG) by tracing the model. Then, it groups together the operations and parameters into _pipeline stages_. Stages are represented as `submod_N` submodules, where `N` is a natural number.
We used `annotate_split_points` to specify that the code should be split and the end of `layer0` and `layer1`. Our code has thus been split into _three_ pipeline stages. PiPPy also provides `SplitPoint.BEGINNING` if a user wants to split before certain annotation point.
While the `annotate_split_points` API gives users a way to specify the split points without modifying the model, PiPPy also provides an API for in-model annotation: `pipe_split()`. For details, you can read [this example](https://github.com/pytorch/PiPPy/blob/main/test/test_pipe.py).
This covers the basic usage of the `Pipe` API. For more information, see the documentation.
## Using PipelineStage for Pipelined Execution
[](https://github.com/pytorch/PiPPy/#using-pipelinestage-for-pipelined-execution)
Given the above `Pipe` object, we can use one of the `PipelineStage` classes to execute our model in a pipelined fashion. First off, let us instantiate a `PipelineStage` instance:
```
# We are using `torchrun` to run this example with multiple processes.
# `torchrun` defines two environment variables: `RANK` and `WORLD_SIZE`.
rank = int(os.environ["RANK"])
world_size = int(os.environ["WORLD_SIZE"])
# Initialize distributed environment
import torch.distributed as dist
dist.init_process_group(rank=rank, world_size=world_size)
# Pipeline stage is our main pipeline runtime. It takes in the pipe object,
# the rank of this process, and the device.
from pippy.PipelineStage import PipelineStage
stage = PipelineStage(pipe, rank, device)
```

We can now run the pipeline by passing input to the first `PipelineStage`:
```
# Input data
x = torch.randn(batch_size, in_dim, device=device)
# Run the pipeline with input `x`. Divide the batch into 4 micro-batches
# and run them in parallel on the pipeline
if rank == 0:
  stage(x)
elif rank == world_size - 1:
  output = stage()
else:
  stage()
```

Note that since we split our model into three stages, we must run this script with three workers. For this example, we will use `torchrun` to run multiple processes within a single machine for demonstration purposes. We can collect up all of the code blocks above into a file named [example.py](https://github.com/pytorch/PiPPy/blob/main/examples/basic/example.py) and then run it with `torchrun` like so:
```
torchrun --nproc_per_node=3 example.py

```
