What’s the difference?\nNo. LangGraph is an orchestration framework for complex agentic systems and is more low-level and controllable than LangChain agents. LangChain provides a standard interface to interact with models and other components, useful for straight-forward chains and retrieval flows. \nHow is LangGraph different from other agent frameworks?\nOther agentic frameworks can work for simple, generic tasks but fall short for complex tasks bespoke to a company’s needs. LangGraph provides a more expressive framework to handle companies’ unique tasks without restricting users to a single black-box cognitive architecture.\nDoes LangGraph impact the performance of my app?\nLangGraph will not add any overhead to your code and is specifically designed with streaming workflows in mind.\nIs LangGraph open source? Is it free?\nYes. LangGraph is an MIT-licensed open-source library and is free to use.\nHow are LangGraph and LangGraph Platform different?\nLangGraph is a stateful, orchestration framework that brings added control to agent workflows. LangGraph Platform is a service for deploying and scaling LangGraph applications, with an opinionated API for building agent UXs, plus an integrated developer studio.\nLangGraph (open source)\nLangGraph Platform\nFeatures\nDescription\nPrices for traces vary depending on the data retention period you've set. \nStateful orchestration framework for agentic applications\nScalable infrastructure for deploying LangGraph applications\nSDKs\nPrices for traces vary depending on the data retention period you've set. \nPython and JavaScript\nPython and JavaScript\nPrices for traces vary depending on the data retention period you've set. \nHTTP APIs\nNone\nYes - useful for retrieving & updating state or long-term memory, or creating a configurable assistant\nStreaming\nPrices for traces vary depending on the data retention period you've set. \nBasic\nDedicated mode for token-by-token messages\nCheckpointer\nPrices for traces vary depending on the data retention period you've set. \nCommunity contributed\nSupported out-of-the-box\nPersistence Layer\nPrices for traces vary depending on the data retention period you've set. \nSelf-managed\nManaged Postgres with efficient storage\nDeployment\nPrices for traces vary depending on the data retention period you've set. \nSelf-managed\n- Cloud SaaS- Free self-hosted- Enterprise (BYOC or paid self-hosted)\nScalability\nPrices for traces vary depending on the data retention period you've set. \nSelf-managed\nAuto-scaling of task queues and servers\nFault-tolerance\nPrices for traces vary depending on the data retention period you've set. \nSelf-managed\nAutomated retries\nConcurrency Control\nPrices for traces vary depending on the data retention period you've set. \nSimple threading\nSupports double-texting\nScheduling\nPrices for traces vary depending on the data retention period you've set. \nNone\nCron scheduling\nMonitoring\nPrices for traces vary depending on the data retention period you've set. \nNone\nIntegrated with LangSmith for observability\nIDE integration\nPrices for traces vary depending on the data retention period you've set. \nLangGraph Studio for Desktop\nLangGraph Studio for Desktop & Cloud\nWhat are my deployment options for LangGraph Platform?\nWe currently have the following deployment options for LangGraph applications:‍**Self-Hosted Lite** : A free (up to 1M nodes executed), limited version of LangGraph Platform that you can run locally or in a self-hosted manner. This version requires a LangSmith API key and logs all usage to LangSmith.
