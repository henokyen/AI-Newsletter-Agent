üîß The term "fine-tuning" includes completely different categories, with different objectives. 1Ô∏è‚É£ General-purpose fine-tuning corresponds to the instruct models produced by LLM providers. This approach is used both at [Liquid AI](https://www.linkedin.com/company/liquid-ai-inc?trk=public_post-text) and by organizations like Meta that release open-weight models. Here, the objective is to build a general-purpose AI assistant that can do most tasks. Because we have a super broad objective, this often requires over 1M samples just for supervised fine-tuning. 2Ô∏è‚É£ Domain-specific fine-tuning targets domains like finance, law, medicine, specific languages, etc. The goal is slightly similar to general-purpose fine-tuning but within a defined category. This type of fine-tuning often benefits from continual pre-training (CPT) if your domain is poorly represented in the pre-training data. This type of fine-tuning tends to disappear because base models are getting better and better. However, it is still useful for niche domains and rare languages. You can see an example of a pipeline with CPT and model merging to create a strong domain-specific LLM. ‚Üì 3Ô∏è‚É£ Task-specific fine-tuning is defined by its narrow scope, like summarization, information extraction, etc. This is quite popular with small models. With the right dataset, you reach the performance of frontier LLMs using cheap and fast models for your use case. It requires more tinkering but this can also build interesting technical moats. Because of the narrow focus, this also requires a lot fewer samples than the other types of fine-tuning. If you use fine-tuning in your daily job, I'm super interested in knowing more about your use cases. This is not an influencer trick to get comments, I'm genuinely trying to update my view of the FT landscape. :))

I‚Äôve worked on task-specific fine-tuning for summarization, and you‚Äôre spot on about the value of smaller datasets and technical moats. What‚Äôs your take on combining task-specific fine-tuning with retrieval-augmented generation for specialized use cases?

And it just gets even more complicated when we bring up all the various parameter efficient techniques for fine tuning, or the same-same but different techniques like representation/attention engineering (I.e control vectors, golden gate Claude, etc) When folks just say ‚Äúfine tuning‚Äù I‚Äôm like ‚Äúwhat do you really mean?

Fine-tuning still makes a significant difference, even for SOTA models. One use case I've recently encountered is scoring text according to arbitrary criteria. It involves an initial human-curated dataset and possibly augmenting that with AI-generated datasets.

How do you manage the data requirements for general-purpose fine-tuning, especially when needing over 1M supervised samples?

GPT-4o's Regression: Recent Findings üé¢ We recently noticed a significant regression in GPT-4o's guardrail capability, starting last week. Here's what you need to know if you are using GPT-4o: Our Testing Process üïµÔ∏è‚ôÇÔ∏è We consistently evaluate LLMs' many abilities related to agentic workflows to power data analytics systems, including reasoning and guardrails (to block queries about data not present in a given database schema), along with many others. For guardrails, we evaluate their ability to block out-of-scope or inappropriate queries (such as requests for employee data when the database only contains orders and products). The system should say, "Sorry, I can't answer that" instead of returning a made-up query. The Results üìä - GPT-4-turbo: Blocked 90% of out-of-scope queries. (But it's more than 2x slower and more expensive than GPT-4o). - GPT-4o-2024-05-13 (the current GPT-4o): Only blocked 30%, down from a previous GPT-4o 70-80% based on our evaluation history. - GPT-4o-2024-08-06: Blocked 80% out-of-scope queries. Action Taken üîÑ - We're updating Waii's default LLM to GPT-4o-2024-08-06 for improved accuracy and safety. - We added a step to our agent step to reach a 100% blocking ratio for out-of-scope queries. Key Takeaways üß† - Consistent measurement is crucial. - Regular monitoring helps catch regressions early. - Even flagship AI models can have significant performance fluctuations! Have you observed similar issues? How do you monitor your AI systems? I'd like to hear your thoughts (please comment below).

GPT-4o's Regression: Recent Findings üé¢ We recently noticed a significant regression in GPT-4o's guardrail capability, starting last week. Here's what you need to know if you are using GPT-4o: Our Testing Process üïµÔ∏è‚ôÇÔ∏è We consistently evaluate LLMs' many abilities related to agentic workflows to power data analytics systems, including reasoning and guardrails (to block queries about data not present in a given database schema), along with many others. For guardrails, we evaluate their ability to block out-of-scope or inappropriate queries (such as requests for employee data when the database only contains orders and products). The system should say, "Sorry, I can't answer that" instead of returning a made-up query. The Results üìä - GPT-4-turbo: Blocked 90% of out-of-scope queries. (But it's more than 2x slower and more expensive than GPT-4o). - GPT-4o-2024-05-13 (the current GPT-4o): Only blocked 30%, down from a previous GPT-4o 70-80% based on our evaluation history. - GPT-4o-2024-08-06: Blocked 80% out-of-scope queries. Action Taken üîÑ - We're updating Waii's default LLM to GPT-4o-2024-08-06 for improved accuracy and safety. - We added a step to our agent step to reach a 100% blocking ratio for out-of-scope queries. Key Takeaways üß† - Consistent measurement is crucial. - Regular monitoring helps catch regressions early. - Even flagship AI models can have significant performance fluctuations! Have you observed similar issues? How do you monitor your AI systems? I'd like to hear your thoughts (please comment below).

What is ùêëùêûùê≠ùê´ùê¢ùêûùêØùêöùê•-ùêÄùêÆùê†ùê¶ùêûùêßùê≠ùêûùêù ùêÜùêûùêßùêûùê´ùêöùê≠ùê¢ùê®ùêß (ùêëùêÄùêÜ)? Imagine this: you‚Äôre asking the model something complex, and instead of just digging through what it learned months (or even years!) ago, it actually goes out, finds the freshest info, and brings it right back to you in its answer. That‚Äôs Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) in action. RAG is like an AI with a search engine built in. Instead of winging it with just its trained data, it actively pulls in real-time facts from external sources and combines them with its own insights. The result? You get a response that‚Äôs not only coherent but packed with relevant, up-to-date information. How it works? 1. Query encoding: When a user inputs a question, it‚Äôs encoded into a format that a search engine or database can process. The encoding turns the question into a vector or "embedding". 2. Retrieval phase: The retriever component then ‚Äúsearches‚Äù within an external database or document repository for relevant information. This step is critical as it brings in fresh, factual data, unlike traditional models that rely solely on pre-trained knowledge. The retrieved documents, often ranked by relevance, provide context for the response. 3. Generation phase: The embedding model takes both the initial query and the retrieved information. It compares these numeric values to vectors in a machine-readable index of an available knowledge base. Then it finds a match or multiple matches and retrieves the related data, converts it to words, and passes it back to the LLm. 4. Response generation: With retrieved data, LLM combines the retrieved words and crafts response as an answer to the user. Pros and Cons ‚ûï Pros: real-time access, improved accuracy, reduced hallucination, transparency ‚ûñ Cons: complex implementation, increased latency, resource-intensive, dependency on data quality [#ai](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Fai&trk=public_post-text) [#ml](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Fml&trk=public_post-text) [#llm](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Fllm&trk=public_post-text) [#rag](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Frag&trk=public_post-text) [#techwithterezija](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Ftechwithterezija&trk=public_post-text)

Are AI evaluators the missing piece for more reliable AI? Our amazing research team just published a comprehensive literature review of LLM judges, with surprising insights: - No Single Recipe: The training of AI evaluators is an evolving research field. - Data Quality & Scale: Bigger datasets don‚Äôt always win‚Äîfiltering and careful curation can outperform raw volume. - Reward Models vs. Generative Models: They‚Äôre converging, leading to models that combine numeric scores and natural language critiques. - On- vs. Off-Policy Training: Self-generated data can improve alignment, but it‚Äôs not yet a proven silver bullet. - Trade-Offs in Model Size: Jumping from 8B to 70B parameters doesn‚Äôt always justify the extra compute costs. - Synthetic Data: Well-designed prompts and multi-step generation can produce data better than what the model started with. - Benchmarks: Saturation on popular benchmarks drives the need for more diverse, next-gen evaluations. Andrei Alexandru led the effort with contributions from [Antonia Calvi](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/antonia-calvi-1a762412b?trk=public_post-text), [Henry Broomfield](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/henry-broomfield?trk=public_post-text), [Roman Engeler](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/roman-engeler-54416212b?trk=public_post-text) and [Sashank Pisupati](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/spisupati?trk=public_post-text)!

I love a well written blog post that breaks down ML papers. This post, by Melanie Mitchell, looks at three different papers (including the most recent Apple paper) that have shown the problems with giving complex reasoning tasks to LLMs. The write up of "The embers of autoregressive training" is probably my favourite of the three, and goes a long way to help people understand how to use LLMs effectively. "First, we have shown that LLMs perform worse on rare tasks than on common ones, so we should be cautious about applying them to tasks that are rare in pretraining data. Second, we have shown that LLMs perform worse on examples with low-probability answers than ones with high-probability answers, so we should be careful about using LLMs in situations where they might need to produce low-probability text. Overcoming these limitations is an important target for future work in AI." To me, this highlights the importance of using specific tools and approaches to create more reliable AI agents. Here are some key strategies, though this isn't an exhaustive list: 1. Use Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to ground LLM responses in actual data and documentation, steering them toward high-probability answers that are actually correct. 2. Implement tools that allow you to chain LLMs together with observable outputs at each step. This creates checkpoints where you can monitor and verify the LLM's behavior. 3. Limit LLM "reasoning" to specific, constrained tasks they're good at, such as: - Verifying outputs against retrieved documents - Classifying conversation directions - Determining when to ask clarifying questions - Analyzing whether responses align with given context These strategies do come with trade-offs - particularly increased latency and token usage. However, this focus on quality and control has an additional benefit: it generates a valuable pool of high-quality, verified interactions that could be used to fine-tune smaller, more efficient models down the line. The key is to build systems where you have control and observability over how the LLM is responding, rather than treating it as a black box reasoner. Your own reasoning should focus on designing these control mechanisms to help the LLM arrive at high-probability, verifiable answers. While I may be biased, I think [Voiceflow](https://ca.linkedin.com/company/voiceflowhq?trk=public_post-text) does a pretty good job at implementing these principles - providing the tools for RAG, observable chaining, and controlled LLM interactions in a practical way. Link to the post in the comments, and the PDF attached is the paper itself.

Long context windows in LLMs give you the ability to work with huge amounts of unstructured data with limited data pre-processing. Theoretically, Google's recent Gemini model is capable of handling the entire text of the Harry Potter series in a single prompt. Wild stuff. Here's a detailed post about how I experimented with long context windows, and some more info below if you don't want to click into the post: [https://lnkd.in/eFBqW9pt](https://www.linkedin.com/redir/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Flnkd%2Ein%2FeFBqW9pt&urlhash=K6JT&trk=public_post-text) Are you or your company trying to build something that could use some AI / LLM expertise? I'd love to hear from you. I'm open to Fractional CTO roles, co-founder roles, and AI / LLM consulting roles starting in September. ___________________________ I used long context windows to help me analyze small cap company annual report pdfs. Without any pre-processing, I had the Gemini model rank investment opportunities using 1000 pages of unstructured PDF reports. Check out the YouTube video: [https://lnkd.in/eJZehqRm](https://www.linkedin.com/redir/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Flnkd%2Ein%2FeJZehqRm&urlhash=FHGG&trk=public_post-text), and the steps I took in the post above. I also highlight how you can use multiple LLM tools to solve your problem, you don't have to choose just one. Also, if you don't know what prompts to use, the LLM can help you with that too - you can ask it to help you build your prompts! Here are the basic steps I took: 1. Used Claude Anthropic to give me a set of criteria to screen for small cap stocks. It gave me 5 attributes to use. 2. Used the [FinViz.com](https://www.linkedin.com/redir/redirect?url=http%3A%2F%2FFinViz%2Ecom&urlhash=ihAq&trk=public_post-text) screening tool to find 10 stocks to analyze 3. Downloaded the annual report PDFs from [AnnualReports.com](https://www.linkedin.com/redir/redirect?url=http%3A%2F%2FAnnualReports%2Ecom&urlhash=jVsw&trk=public_post-text) 4. Used ChatGPT to generate a prompt for analyzing the PDFs 5. Posted all of the PDFs, along with the prompt from step 4, into Google AI Studio (Gemini) The attached image is a snapshot of the result from Gemini. Amazing to be able to do this for free and in less than 30 minutes. What are you building and learning? Where do you need help? Send me a note, I'd love to hear from you.

A Challenge No LLM Can Solve (Yet!) üö® Sounds straightforward, right? Well none of the SOTA LLMs out there I tested were able to solve this even after trying different prompting strategies including CoT, Self-reflection and RAG etc. üöß The Problem: Bit-Reversal Permutation on a Perfect Binary Tree üöß Consider the problem of inverting a perfect binary tree. That's an old, entry-level interview question that humans and LLMs can solve easily. Now, let's add just 3 key nuances to make it new and unique: 1. It must invert the keys ("bit-reversal permutation") 2. It must be a dependency-free, pure recursive function 3. It must have type Bit -> Tree -> Tree (i.e., a direct recursion with max 1 bit state) For a detailed problem example, check out this problem created by VictorTaelin below and test them by yourself GitHub gist - [https://lnkd.in/gxgAsBsX](https://www.linkedin.com/redir/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Flnkd%2Ein%2FgxgAsBsX&urlhash=_n99&trk=public_post-text) üß† Prompts I Used (For the Curious) üß† To improve performance of the model I used a prompting technique created by Harish SG a few weeks back combines Verbal Reinforcement Learning Reflection and Dynamic Chain of Thought (CoT) Claude 3. 5 Sonnet was able to outperform OpenAIs o1 model thanks to the application of this method. But no matter how I refined the prompts using Dynamic CoT, Reflection, or Verbal Reinforcement Learning they still fail miserably to reason through the problem despite long context length limitations as well. Why This Matters? 1. It lacks a significant gap between human-like reasoning and AI's pattern reasoning abilities. 2. It challenges the understanding of AI's problem-solving capabilities vs Human solving capabilities 3. It provides a clear benchmark for measuring progress in AI reasoning. LLMs no matter how exceptional they are, still far from true reasoning. Agree? They excel in pattern recognition and text generation but struggle with nuanced, recursive problems that require structured, abstract thinking especially when those problems haven‚Äôt been explicitly solved in their training data.
