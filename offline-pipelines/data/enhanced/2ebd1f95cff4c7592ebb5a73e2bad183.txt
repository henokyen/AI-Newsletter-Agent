### What Is SQLite?
SQLite is a C-language library that implements a [small](https://www.sqlite.org/footprint.html), [fast](https://www.sqlite.org/fasterthanfs.html), [self-contained](https://www.sqlite.org/selfcontained.html), [high-reliability](https://www.sqlite.org/hirely.html), [full-featured](https://www.sqlite.org/fullsql.html), SQL database engine. SQLite is the [most used](https://www.sqlite.org/mostdeployed.html) database engine in the world. SQLite is built into all mobile phones and most computers and comes bundled inside countless other applications that people use every day. [More Information...](https://www.sqlite.org/about.html)
The SQLite [file format](https://www.sqlite.org/fileformat2.html) is stable, cross-platform, and backwards compatible and the developers pledge to keep it that way [through the year 2050](https://www.sqlite.org/lts.html). SQLite database files are commonly used as containers to transfer rich content between systems [[1]](https://www.sqlite.org/aff_short.html) [[2]](https://www.sqlite.org/sqlar.html) [[3]](https://www.sqlite.org/appfileformat.html) and as a long-term archival format for data [[4]](https://www.sqlite.org/locrsf.html). There are over 1 trillion (1e12) SQLite databases in active use [[5]](https://www.sqlite.org/mostdeployed.html). 
SQLite [source code](https://sqlite.org/src) is in the [public-domain](https://www.sqlite.org/copyright.html) and is free to everyone to use for any purpose.
