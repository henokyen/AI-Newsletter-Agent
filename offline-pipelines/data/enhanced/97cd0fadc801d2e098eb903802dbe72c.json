When building a dataset, we target the three following characteristics:\n  * **Accuracy** : Samples should be factually correct and relevant to their corresponding instructions. This can involve using solvers for math and unit tests for code.\n  * **Diversity** : You want to cover as many use cases as possible to make sure you're never out of distribution. High diversity is essential as it leads to better generalization.\n  * **Complexity** : Answers should be both detailed (to maximize helpfulness) and include system 2 techniques like chain of thought (to force step-by-step reasoning).\n\n\nMeasuring accuracy is easy in most cases but near-impossible with open-ended, subjective questions. On the other hand, clustering datasets by topic is a good way of evaluating data mixture diversity. Finally, complexity can be assessed using other LLMs acting like judges.\n## 📅 Open SFT datasets\n[](https://github.com/mlabonne/llm-datasets/#-open-sft-datasets)\nOnce a model has been pre-trained on a next-token prediction task, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) is used to turn it into an assistant capable of answering questions and following instructions. These datasets contain pairs of instructions and outputs to train LLMs to understand conversational structure. Unless otherwise noted, all datasets listed here are under permissive licenses (Apache 2.0, MIT, CC-BY-4.0, etc.).\n### General-purpose mixtures\n[](https://github.com/mlabonne/llm-datasets/#general-purpose-mixtures)\nGeneral-purpose datasets offer balanced mixtures of different types of data, including chat, code, and math. These datasets can be used to create general-purpose models that can handle various types of queries.\nDataset | # | Authors | Date | Notes  \n---|---|---|---|---  \n[Infinity-Instruct](https://huggingface.co/datasets/BAAI/Infinity-Instruct) | 7.45M | BAAI | Aug 2024 | High-quality evolved samples based on a collection of open-source datasets.  \n[WebInstructSub](https://huggingface.co/datasets/chargoddard/WebInstructSub-prometheus) | 2.39M | Yue et al. | May 2024 | Instructions created by retrieving document from Common Crawl, extracting QA pairs, and refining them.

Preference alignment is used to align LLM's answers with human preferences to adopt the desired style and values.\nDataset | # | Authors | Date | Notes  \n---|---|---|---|---  \n[Skywork-Reward-Preference-80K-v0.2](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Skywork/Skywork-Reward-Preference-80K-v0.2) | 77k | Skywork | 2024 | Preference pairs compiled from public sources like HelpSteer2, OffsetBias, WildGuard, and Magpie.  \n[ultrafeedback-binarized-preferences-cleaned](https://huggingface.co/datasets/argilla/ultrafeedback-binarized-preferences-cleaned) | 61.1k | Argilla | 2023 | Decontaminated version of the UltraChat dataset, scored by GPT-4 and binarized into \"chosen\" and \"rejected\" answers based on these scores.  \n[Infinity-Preference](https://huggingface.co/datasets/BAAI/Infinity-Preference) | 59k | BAAI | Sep 2024 | Adjusts preference attribute weights per task using Infinity-Instruct's labeling system.

Start by aggregating available data from various sources (open-source or not) and applying filters like data deduplication and data quality. If the initial dataset is small or insufficient, consider synthetically generating additional data to fill the gap.
