| [**Documentation**](https://docs.cupy.dev/en/stable/) | [**API Reference**](https://docs.cupy.dev/en/stable/reference/) | [**Forum**](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/cupy)\nCuPy is a NumPy/SciPy-compatible array library for GPU-accelerated computing with Python. CuPy acts as a [drop-in replacement](https://docs.cupy.dev/en/stable/reference/comparison.html) to run existing NumPy/SciPy code on NVIDIA CUDA or AMD ROCm platforms.\n```\n>>> import cupy as cp\n>>> x = cp.arange(6).reshape(2, 3).astype('f')\n>>> x\narray([[ 0., 1., 2.],\n    [ 3., 4., 5.]], dtype=float32)\n>>> x.sum(axis=1)\narray([ 3., 12.], dtype=float32)\n```\n\nCuPy also provides access to low-level CUDA features. You can pass `ndarray` to existing CUDA C/C++ programs via [RawKernels](https://docs.cupy.dev/en/stable/user_guide/kernel.html#raw-kernels), use [Streams](https://docs.cupy.dev/en/stable/reference/cuda.html) for performance, or even call [CUDA Runtime APIs](https://docs.cupy.dev/en/stable/reference/cuda.html#runtime-api) directly.\n## Installation\n[](https://github.com/cupy/cupy/#installation)\n### Pip\n[](https://github.com/cupy/cupy/#pip)\nBinary packages (wheels) are available for Linux and Windows on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/org/cupy/). Choose the right package for your platform.\nPlatform | Architecture | Command  \n---|---|---  \nCUDA 11.x (11.2+) | x86_64 / aarch64 | `pip install cupy-cuda11x`  \nCUDA 12.x | x86_64 / aarch64 | `pip install cupy-cuda12x`  \nROCm 4.3 (_[experimental](https://docs.cupy.dev/en/latest/install.html#using-cupy-on-amd-gpu-experimental)_) | x86_64 | `pip install cupy-rocm-4-3`  \nROCm 5.0 (_[experimental](https://docs.cupy.dev/en/latest/install.html#using-cupy-on-amd-gpu-experimental)_) | x86_64 | `pip install cupy-rocm-5-0`  \nNote\nTo install pre-releases, append `--pre -U -f https://pip.cupy.dev/pre` (e.g., `pip install cupy-cuda11x --pre -U -f https://pip.cupy.dev/pre`).\n### Conda\n[](https://github.com/cupy/cupy/#conda)\nBinary packages are also available for Linux and Windows on [Conda-Forge](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/cupy).\nPlatform | Architecture | Command  \n---|---|---  \nCUDA | x86_64 / aarch64 / ppc64le | `conda install -c conda-forge cupy`  \nIf you need a slim installation (without also getting CUDA dependencies installed), you can do `conda install -c conda-forge cupy-core`.\nIf you need to use a particular CUDA version (say 12.0), you can use the `cuda-version` metapackage to select the version, e.g. `conda install -c conda-forge cupy cuda-version=12.0`.\nNote\nIf you encounter any problem with CuPy installed from `conda-forge`, please feel free to report to [cupy-feedstock](https://github.com/conda-forge/cupy-feedstock/issues), and we will help investigate if it is just a packaging issue in `conda-forge`'s recipe or a real issue in CuPy.\n### Docker\n[](https://github.com/cupy/cupy/#docker)\nUse [NVIDIA Container Toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/overview.html) to run [CuPy container images](https://hub.docker.com/r/cupy/cupy).\n```\n$ docker run --gpus all -it cupy/cupy\n\n```\n\n## Resources\n[](https://github.com/cupy/cupy/#resources)\n  * [Installation Guide](https://docs.cupy.dev/en/stable/install.html) - instructions on building from source\n  * [Release Notes](https://github.com/cupy/cupy/releases)\n  * [Projects using CuPy](https://github.com/cupy/cupy/wiki/Projects-using-CuPy)\n  * [Contribution Guide](https://docs.cupy.dev/en/stable/contribution.html)\n  * [GPU Acceleration in Python using CuPy and Numba (GTC November 2021 Technical Session)](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/on-demand/session/gtcfall21-a31149/)\n  * [GPU-Acceleration of Signal Processing Workflows using CuPy and cuSignal](https://github.com/awthomp/cusignal-icassp-tutorial)[1](https://github.com/cupy/cupy/#user-content-fn-1-00ae66f9a12c7e86ad9bd40b4816181f) (ICASSP'21 Tutorial)\n\n\n## License\n[](https://github.com/cupy/cupy/#license)\nMIT License (see `LICENSE` file).\nCuPy is designed based on NumPy's API and SciPy's API (see `docs/source/license.rst` file).\nCuPy is being developed and maintained by [Preferred Networks](https://www.preferred.jp/en/) and [community contributors](https://github.com/cupy/cupy/graphs/contributors).\n## Reference\n[](https://github.com/cupy/cupy/#reference)\nRyosuke Okuta, Yuya Unno, Daisuke Nishino, Shohei Hido and Crissman Loomis. **CuPy: A NumPy-Compatible Library for NVIDIA GPU Calculations.** _Proceedings of Workshop on Machine Learning Systems (LearningSys) in The Thirty-first Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS)_ , (2017).
