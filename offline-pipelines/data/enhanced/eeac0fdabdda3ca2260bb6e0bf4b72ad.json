They may also return irrelevant material which can distract the LLM from the correct results. \nThis course teaches advanced retrieval techniques to improve the relevancy of retrieved results.\nThe techniques covered include: \n  * Query Expansion: Expanding user queries improves information retrieval by including related concepts and keywords. Utilizing an LLM makes this traditional technique even more effective. Another form of expansion has the LLM suggest a possible answer to the query which is then included in the query.\n  * Cross-encoder reranking: Reranking retrieval results to select the results most relevant to your query improves your results.\n  * Training and utilizing Embedding Adapters: Adding an adapter layer to reshape embeddings can improve retrieval by emphasizing elements relevant to your application. \n\n\n## Who should join?\nAnyone who has intermediate Python knowledge and wants to learn advanced retrieval techniques for retrieving data from their vector database.\n## Course Outline\n7 Lessons・5 Code Examples\n  * Introduction\nVideo・3 mins\n  * Overview of embeddings-based retrieval\nVideo with code examples・12 mins\n  * Pitfalls of retrieval - when simple vector search fails\nVideo with code examples・11 mins\n  * Query Expansion\nVideo with code examples・9 mins\n  * Cross-encoder re-ranking\nVideo with code examples・6 mins\n  * Embedding adaptors\nVideo with code examples・8 mins\n  * Other Techniques\nVideo・1 mins\n\n\n## Instructor\n![Anton Troynikov](https://www.deeplearning.ai/_next/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fhome-wordpress.deeplearning.ai%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2023%2F12%2FChroma-founder.jpg&w=256&q=75)\n### Anton Troynikov\nCo-founder, Chroma\n  * [](https://twitter.com/atroyn)\n\n\n## Advanced Retrieval for AI with Chroma\n  * Intermediate\n  * 53 Minutes\n  * 7 Video Lessons\n  * 5 Code Examples\n  * Instructor: Anton Troynikov\n  *     * ![Chroma](https://www.deeplearning.ai/_next/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fhome-wordpress.deeplearning.ai%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2024%2F01%2FChroma.png&w=48&q=75)\nChroma\n\n\n[Enroll for Free](https://learn.deeplearning.ai/advanced-retrieval-for-ai?utm_source=home&utm_medium=course-landing-page&utm_campaign=summary-cta-button)\nCourse access is free for a limited time during the DeepLearning.AI learning platform beta!\n[Enroll for Free](https://learn.deeplearning.ai/advanced-retrieval-for-ai?utm_source=home&utm_medium=course-landing-page&utm_campaign=promotional-banner-cta-button)\n## Want to learn more about Generative AI?\nKeep learning with updates on curated AI news, courses, and events, as well as Andrew’s thoughts from DeepLearning.AI! \n[Enroll for Free](https://learn.deeplearning.ai/advanced-retrieval-for-ai?utm_source=home&utm_medium=course-landing-page&utm_campaign=summary-cta-button)\n  * [Courses](https://www.deeplearning.ai/courses/)\n  * [The Batch](https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/)\n  * [Community](https://www.deeplearning.ai/community/)\n  * [Careers](https://www.deeplearning.ai/careers/)\n  * [About](https://www.deeplearning.ai/about/)\n\n\n[](https://www.facebook.com/1027125564106325)[](https://www.instagram.com/deeplearningai)[](https://twitter.com/deeplearningai)[](https://www.linkedin.com/company/18246783)[](https://www.youtube.com/c/Deeplearningai)\n",
