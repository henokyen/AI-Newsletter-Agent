Set an environment variable called `OPENAI_API_KEY` with your API key. Alternatively, in most IDEs such as Visual Studio Code, you can create an `.env` file at the root of your repo containing `OPENAI_API_KEY=<your API key>`, which will be picked up by the notebooks.\nMost code examples are written in Python, though the concepts can be applied in any language.\nFor other useful tools, guides and courses, check out these [related resources from around the web](https://cookbook.openai.com/related_resources).\n## License\n[](https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook/#license)\nMIT\n## About\nExamples and guides for using the OpenAI API \n[cookbook.openai.com](https://cookbook.openai.com \"https://cookbook.openai.com\")\n### Topics\n[ openai ](https://github.com/topics/openai \"Topic: openai\") [ openai-api ](https://github.com/topics/openai-api \"Topic: openai-api\") [ gpt-4 ](https://github.com/topics/gpt-4 \"Topic: gpt-4\") [ chatgpt ](https://github.com/topics/chatgpt \"Topic: chatgpt\")\n### Resources\n[ Readme ](https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook/#readme-ov-file)\n### License\n[ MIT license ](https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook/#MIT-1-ov-file)\n[ Activity](https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook/activity)\n[ Custom properties](https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook/custom-properties)\n### Stars\n[ **62.5k** stars](https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook/stargazers)\n### Watchers\n[ **918** watching](https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook/watchers)\n### Forks\n[ **10.1k** forks](https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook/forks)\n[ Report repository ](https://github.com/contact/report-content?content_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fopenai%2Fopenai-cookbook&report=openai+%28user%29)\n##  [Contributors 272](https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook/graphs/contributors)\n[+ 258 contributors](https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook/graphs/contributors)\n## Languages\n  * [ MDX 100.0% ](https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook/search?l=mdx)\n\n\n## Footer\n[ ](https://github.com \"GitHub\") © 2025 GitHub, Inc. \n### Footer navigation\n  * [Terms](https://docs.github.com/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-of-service)\n  * [Privacy](https://docs.github.com/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement)\n  * [Security](https://github.com/security)\n  * [Status](https://www.githubstatus.com/)\n  * [Docs](https://docs.github.com/)\n  * [Contact](https://support.github.com?tags=dotcom-footer)\n  * Manage cookies \n  * Do not share my personal information \n\n\nYou can’t perform that action at this time. \n",
