# â¡ï¸ What is FastEmbed?
[](https://github.com/qdrant/fastembed/#ï¸-what-is-fastembed)
FastEmbed is a lightweight, fast, Python library built for embedding generation. We [support popular text models](https://qdrant.github.io/fastembed/examples/Supported_Models/). Please [open a GitHub issue](https://github.com/qdrant/fastembed/issues/new) if you want us to add a new model.
The default text embedding (`TextEmbedding`) model is Flag Embedding, presented in the [MTEB](https://huggingface.co/spaces/mteb/leaderboard) leaderboard. It supports "query" and "passage" prefixes for the input text. Here is an example for [Retrieval Embedding Generation](https://qdrant.github.io/fastembed/qdrant/Retrieval_with_FastEmbed/) and how to use [FastEmbed with Qdrant](https://qdrant.github.io/fastembed/qdrant/Usage_With_Qdrant/).
## ð Why FastEmbed?
[](https://github.com/qdrant/fastembed/#-why-fastembed)
  1. Light: FastEmbed is a lightweight library with few external dependencies. We don't require a GPU and don't download GBs of PyTorch dependencies, and instead use the ONNX Runtime. This makes it a great candidate for serverless runtimes like AWS Lambda.
  2. Fast: FastEmbed is designed for speed. We use the ONNX Runtime, which is faster than PyTorch. We also use data parallelism for encoding large datasets.
  3. Accurate: FastEmbed is better than OpenAI Ada-002. We also [support](https://qdrant.github.io/fastembed/examples/Supported_Models/) an ever-expanding set of models, including a few multilingual models.


## ð Installation
[](https://github.com/qdrant/fastembed/#-installation)
To install the FastEmbed library, pip works best. You can install it with or without GPU support:
```
pip install fastembed
# or with GPU support
pip install fastembed-gpu
```

## ð Quickstart
[](https://github.com/qdrant/fastembed/#-quickstart)
```
from fastembed import TextEmbedding

# Example list of documents
documents: list[str] = [
  "This is built to be faster and lighter than other embedding libraries e.g. Transformers, Sentence-Transformers, etc.",
  "fastembed is supported by and maintained by Qdrant.",
]
# This will trigger the model download and initialization
embedding_model = TextEmbedding()
print("The model BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5 is ready to use.")
embeddings_generator = embedding_model.embed(documents) # reminder this is a generator
embeddings_list = list(embedding_model.embed(documents))
 # you can also convert the generator to a list, and that to a numpy array
len(embeddings_list[0]) # Vector of 384 dimensions
```

Fastembed supports a variety of models for different tasks and modalities. The list of all the available models can be found [here](https://qdrant.github.io/fastembed/examples/Supported_Models/)
### ð Dense text embeddings
[](https://github.com/qdrant/fastembed/#-dense-text-embeddings)
```
from fastembed import TextEmbedding
model = TextEmbedding(model_name="BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5")
embeddings = list(model.embed(documents))
# [
#  array([-0.1115, 0.0097, 0.0052, 0.0195, ...], dtype=float32),
#  array([-0.1019, 0.0635, -0.0332, 0.0522, ...], dtype=float32)
# ]
```

Dense text embedding can also be extended with models which are not in the list of supported models.
```
from fastembed import TextEmbedding
from fastembed.common.model_description import PoolingType, ModelSource
TextEmbedding.add_custom_model(
  model="intfloat/multilingual-e5-small",
  pooling=PoolingType.MEAN,
  normalization=True,
  sources=ModelSource(hf="intfloat/multilingual-e5-small"), # can be used with an `url` to load files from a private storage
  dim=384,
  model_file="onnx/model.onnx", # can be used to load an already supported model with another optimization or quantization, e.g. onnx/model_O4.onnx
)
model = TextEmbedding(model_name="intfloat/multilingual-e5-small")
embeddings = list(model.embed(documents))
```

scores = list(encoder.rerank(query, documents))
# [-11.48061752319336, 5.472434997558594]
```

Text cross encoders can also be extended with models which are not in the list of supported models.
```
from fastembed.rerank.cross_encoder import TextCrossEncoder 
from fastembed.common.model_description import ModelSource
TextCrossEncoder.add_custom_model(
  model="Xenova/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-4-v2",

)
model = TextCrossEncoder(model_name="Xenova/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-4-v2")
scores = list(model.rerank_pairs(
  [("What is AI?", "Artificial intelligence is ..."), ("What is ML?", "Machine learning is ..."),]
))
```

## â¡ï¸ FastEmbed on a GPU
[](https://github.com/qdrant/fastembed/#ï¸-fastembed-on-a-gpu)
FastEmbed supports running on GPU devices. It requires installation of the `fastembed-gpu` package.
```
pip install fastembed-gpu
```

Check our [example](https://qdrant.github.io/fastembed/examples/FastEmbed_GPU/) for detailed instructions, CUDA 12.x support and troubleshooting of the common issues.
```
from fastembed import TextEmbedding
embedding_model = TextEmbedding(
  model_name="BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5", 
  providers=["CUDAExecutionProvider"]
)
print("The model BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5 is ready to use on a GPU.")
```

## Usage with Qdrant
[](https://github.com/qdrant/fastembed/#usage-with-qdrant)
Installation with Qdrant Client in Python:
```
pip install qdrant-client[fastembed]
```

or
```
pip install qdrant-client[fastembed-gpu]
```

You might have to use quotes `pip install 'qdrant-client[fastembed]'` on zsh.
```
from qdrant_client import QdrantClient
# Initialize the client
client = QdrantClient("localhost", port=6333) # For production
# client = QdrantClient(":memory:") # For small experiments
# Prepare your documents, metadata, and IDs
docs = ["Qdrant has Langchain integrations", "Qdrant also has Llama Index integrations"]
metadata = [
  {"source": "Langchain-docs"},
  {"source": "Llama-index-docs"},
]
ids = [42, 2]
# If you want to change the model:
# client.set_model("sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2")
# List of supported models: https://qdrant.github.io/fastembed/examples/Supported_Models
# Use the new add() instead of upsert()
# This internally calls embed() of the configured embedding model
client.add(
  collection_name="demo_collection",
  documents=docs,
  metadata=metadata,
  ids=ids
)
search_result = client.query(
  collection_name="demo_collection",
  query_text="This is a query document"
)
print(search_result)
```
