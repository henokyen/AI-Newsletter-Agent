## Overview
[](https://github.com/huggingface/trl/#overview)
TRL is a cutting-edge library designed for post-training foundation models using advanced techniques like Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Built on top of the [🤗 Transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) ecosystem, TRL supports a variety of model architectures and modalities, and can be scaled-up across various hardware setups.
## Highlights
[](https://github.com/huggingface/trl/#highlights)
  * **Trainers** : Various fine-tuning methods are easily accessible via trainers like [`SFTTrainer`](https://huggingface.co/docs/trl/sft_trainer), [`GRPOTrainer`](https://huggingface.co/docs/trl/grpo_trainer), [`DPOTrainer`](https://huggingface.co/docs/trl/dpo_trainer), [`RewardTrainer`](https://huggingface.co/docs/trl/reward_trainer) and more.
  * **Efficient and scalable** :
    * Leverages [🤗 Accelerate](https://github.com/huggingface/accelerate) to scale from single GPU to multi-node clusters using methods like [DDP](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/ddp_tutorial.html) and [DeepSpeed](https://github.com/deepspeedai/DeepSpeed).
    * Full integration with [🤗 PEFT](https://github.com/huggingface/peft) enables training on large models with modest hardware via quantization and LoRA/QLoRA.
    * Integrates [🦥 Unsloth](https://github.com/unslothai/unsloth) for accelerating training using optimized kernels.
  * **Command Line Interface (CLI)** : A simple interface lets you fine-tune with models without needing to write code.


## Installation
[](https://github.com/huggingface/trl/#installation)
### Python Package
[](https://github.com/huggingface/trl/#python-package)
Install the library using `pip`:
```
pip install trl
```

### From source
[](https://github.com/huggingface/trl/#from-source)
If you want to use the latest features before an official release, you can install TRL from source:
```
pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/trl.git
```

### Repository
[](https://github.com/huggingface/trl/#repository)
If you want to use the examples you can clone the repository with the following command:
```
git clone https://github.com/huggingface/trl.git
```

## Quick Start
[](https://github.com/huggingface/trl/#quick-start)
For more flexibility and control over training, TRL provides dedicated trainer classes to post-train language models or PEFT adapters on a custom dataset. Each trainer in TRL is a light wrapper around the 🤗 Transformers trainer and natively supports distributed training methods like DDP, DeepSpeed ZeRO, and FSDP.
### `SFTTrainer`
[](https://github.com/huggingface/trl/#sfttrainer)
Here is a basic example of how to use the [`SFTTrainer`](https://huggingface.co/docs/trl/sft_trainer):
```
from trl import SFTTrainer
from datasets import load_dataset
dataset = load_dataset("trl-lib/Capybara", split="train")
trainer = SFTTrainer(
  model="Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B",
  train_dataset=dataset,
)
trainer.train()
```

### `GRPOTrainer`
[](https://github.com/huggingface/trl/#grpotrainer)
[`GRPOTrainer`](https://huggingface.co/docs/trl/grpo_trainer) implements the [Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm](https://huggingface.co/papers/2402.03300) that is more memory-efficient than PPO and was used to train [Deepseek AI's R1](https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1).
```
from datasets import load_dataset
from trl import GRPOTrainer
dataset = load_dataset("trl-lib/tldr", split="train")
# Dummy reward function: count the number of unique characters in the completions
def reward_num_unique_chars(completions, **kwargs):
  return [len(set(c)) for c in completions]
trainer = GRPOTrainer(
  model="Qwen/Qwen2-0.5B-Instruct",
  reward_funcs=reward_num_unique_chars,
  train_dataset=dataset,
)
trainer.train()
```

### `DPOTrainer`
[](https://github.com/huggingface/trl/#dpotrainer)
[`DPOTrainer`](https://huggingface.co/docs/trl/dpo_trainer) implements the popular [Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) algorithm](https://huggingface.co/papers/2305.18290) that was used to post-train [Llama 3](https://huggingface.co/papers/2407.21783) and many other models. Here is a basic example of how to use the `DPOTrainer`:
```
from datasets import load_dataset
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer
from trl import DPOConfig, DPOTrainer
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct")
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct")
dataset = load_dataset("trl-lib/ultrafeedback_binarized", split="train")
training_args = DPOConfig(output_dir="Qwen2.5-0.5B-DPO")
trainer = DPOTrainer(
  model=model,
  args=training_args,
  train_dataset=dataset,
  processing_class=tokenizer
)
trainer.train()
```

### `RewardTrainer`
[](https://github.com/huggingface/trl/#rewardtrainer)
Here is a basic example of how to use the [`RewardTrainer`](https://huggingface.co/docs/trl/reward_trainer):
```
from trl import RewardConfig, RewardTrainer
from datasets import load_dataset
from transformers import AutoModelForSequenceClassification, AutoTokenizer
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct")
model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(
  "Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct", num_labels=1
)
model.config.pad_token_id = tokenizer.pad_token_id
dataset = load_dataset("trl-lib/ultrafeedback_binarized", split="train")
training_args = RewardConfig(output_dir="Qwen2.5-0.5B-Reward", per_device_train_batch_size=2)
trainer = RewardTrainer(
  args=training_args,
  model=model,
  processing_class=tokenizer,
  train_dataset=dataset,
)
trainer.train()
```

## Command Line Interface (CLI)
[](https://github.com/huggingface/trl/#command-line-interface-cli)
You can use the TRL Command Line Interface (CLI) to quickly get started with post-training methods like Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) or Direct Preference Optimization (DPO):
**SFT:**
```
trl sft --model_name_or_path Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B \
  --dataset_name trl-lib/Capybara \
  --output_dir Qwen2.5-0.5B-SFT
```

**DPO:**
```
trl dpo --model_name_or_path Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct \
  --dataset_name argilla/Capybara-Preferences \
  --output_dir Qwen2.5-0.5B-DPO 
```

Read more about CLI in the [relevant documentation section](https://huggingface.co/docs/trl/main/en/clis) or use `--help` for more details.
## Development
