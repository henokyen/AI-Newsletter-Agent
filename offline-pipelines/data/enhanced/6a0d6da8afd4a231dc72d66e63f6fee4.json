Although SageMaker Canvas provides powerful no-code and low-code capabilities for rapid experimentation, some projects might require specialized dependencies and libraries that aren’t included by default in SageMaker Canvas. This post provides an example of how to incorporate code that relies on external dependencies into your SageMaker Canvas workflows.\n[![](https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/f1f836cb4ea6efb2a0b1b99f41ad8b103eff4b59/2025/03/26/featured-images-ml-18118-1-1024x576.jpg)](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/amazon-sagemaker-jumpstart-adds-fine-tuning-support-for-models-in-a-private-model-hub/)\n## [Amazon SageMaker JumpStart adds fine-tuning support for models in a private model hub](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/amazon-sagemaker-jumpstart-adds-fine-tuning-support-for-models-in-a-private-model-hub/)\nby Marc Karp, Benjamin Crabtree, Banu Nagasundaram, and Niris Okram on 26 MAR 2025 in [Amazon SageMaker](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/category/artificial-intelligence/sagemaker/ \"View all posts in Amazon SageMaker\"), [Amazon SageMaker JumpStart](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/category/artificial-intelligence/sagemaker/amazon-sagemaker-jumpstart/ \"View all posts in Amazon SageMaker JumpStart\"), [Announcements](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/category/post-types/announcements/ \"View all posts in Announcements\") [Permalink](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/amazon-sagemaker-jumpstart-adds-fine-tuning-support-for-models-in-a-private-model-hub/) [ Comments](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/amazon-sagemaker-jumpstart-adds-fine-tuning-support-for-models-in-a-private-model-hub/#Comments) [ Share](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/category/artificial-intelligence/sagemaker/?sc_icampaign=pac-sagemaker-blogpost&sc_ichannel=ha&sc_icontent=awssm-2276&sc_iplace=console-right&trk=ha_awssm-2276/)\n  * [](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/amazon-sagemaker-jumpstart-adds-fine-tuning-support-for-models-in-a-private-model-hub/)\n  * [](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet/?text=Amazon%20SageMaker%20JumpStart%20adds%20fine-tuning%20support%20for%20models%20in%20a%20private%20model%20hub&via=awscloud&url=https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/amazon-sagemaker-jumpstart-adds-fine-tuning-support-for-models-in-a-private-model-hub/)\n  * [](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&title=Amazon%20SageMaker%20JumpStart%20adds%20fine-tuning%20support%20for%20models%20in%20a%20private%20model%20hub&source=Amazon%20Web%20Services&url=https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/amazon-sagemaker-jumpstart-adds-fine-tuning-support-for-models-in-a-private-model-hub/)\n  * \n\nToday, we are announcing an enhanced private hub feature with several new capabilities that give organizations greater control over their ML assets.
