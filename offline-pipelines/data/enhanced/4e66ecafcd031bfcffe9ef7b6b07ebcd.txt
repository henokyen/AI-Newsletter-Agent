This PR allows passing down both `ocr_agent` and `table_ocr_agent` as
parameters to specify the `OCRAgent` class for the page and tables, if
any, respectively. Both are default to using `tesseract`, consistent
with the present default behavior.
We used to rely on env variables to specify the agents but os env can be
changed during runtime outside of the caller's control. This method of
passing down the variables ensures that specification is independent of
env changes.
## testing
Using `example-docs/img/layout-parser-paper-with-table.jpg` and run
partition with two different settings. Note that this test requires
`paddleocr` extra.
```python
from unstructured.partition.auto import partition
from unstructured.partition.utils.constants import OCR_AGENT_TESSERACT, OCR_AGENT_PADDLE
elements = partition\(f, strategy="hi_res", skip_infer_table_types=\[\], ocr_agent=OCR_AGENT_TESSERACT, table_ocr_agent=OCR_AGENT_PADDLE\)
elements_alt = partition\(f, strategy="hi_res", skip_infer_table_types=\[\], ocr_agent=OCR_AGENT_PADDLE, table_ocr_agent=OCR_AGENT_TESSERACT\)

Removed the dependencies contained in `test.txt`, `dev.txt`, and
`constraints.txt` from the things that get installed in the docker
image. In order to keep testing the image \(running the tests\), I added a
step to the `docker-test` make target to install `test.txt` and
`dev.txt`. Thus we presumably get a smaller image \(probably not much
smaller\), reduce the dependency chain or our images, and have less
exposure to vulnerabilities while still testing as robustly as before.
Incidentally, I removed the `Dockerfile` for our ubuntu image, since it
made reference to non-existent make targets, which tells me it's stale
and wasn't being used.
### Review:
- Reviewer should ensure the dev and test dependencies are not being
installed in the docker image. One way to check is to check the logs in
CI, and note, e.g. that

This PR is to address \[a
CVE\]\(https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-rgv9-w7jp-m23g\) that appeared in
a recent scan.
The CVE has to do with the package `label_studio_sdk`. This relates to
the tool Label Studio, a data labeling platform. We built a staging
function that takes a list of elements and converts it to a format
suitable for passing to the LabelStudio platform.
We don't use the package with the vulnerability in the actual function,
we only use it to test the output of the function against the Label
Studio API schema.
Even the test where we use it is sort of questionable in value, since
it's really testing the schema against an old version of the LabelStudio
API \(we are testing against a recording of the Label Studio API's
responses stored using `vcrpy`\).
Label Studio has fixed the vulnerability as of version 1.0.10 of their
SDK, but we're stuck on 1.0.5 because 1.0.6 and above require
`numpy<2.0.0`.
This leaves us with several choices of resolution, some of which are:
1. Downgrade `numpy` to upgrade `label_studio_sdk` to >=1.0.10 to
resolve the CVE
2. Drop `label_studio_sdk` by either removing or rewriting the test.
3. Drop test and dev dependencies from the `unstructured` image.
We've decided to do 2. _and_ 3. This PR handles 2., with 3. to be a
follow-on PR.
Here we add a deprecation notice to `stage_for_label_studio` and remove
the offending test. Normally good practice would be to add a warning of
future deprecation to the function for a reasonable amount of time, but
in order to address the CVE immediately, we're deprecating it right
away.
### Testing
Install the dependencies \(`make install`\) into a fresh environment, and
`pip list | grep label` should have no results. The scan artifact in CI
should contain no "high" or "critical" CVEs.")[#3968](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured/pull/3968)[)](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured/commit/3f07840b80a1157ee64af23302f5bb48dfc5e404 "chore: deprecate stage_for_label_studio \(#3968\)

This PR is to address \[a
CVE\]\(https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-rgv9-w7jp-m23g\) that appeared in
a recent scan.
The CVE has to do with the package `label_studio_sdk`. This relates to
the tool Label Studio, a data labeling platform. We built a staging
function that takes a list of elements and converts it to a format
suitable for passing to the LabelStudio platform.
We don't use the package with the vulnerability in the actual function,
we only use it to test the output of the function against the Label
Studio API schema.
Even the test where we use it is sort of questionable in value, since
it's really testing the schema against an old version of the LabelStudio
API \(we are testing against a recording of the Label Studio API's
responses stored using `vcrpy`\).
Label Studio has fixed the vulnerability as of version 1.0.10 of their
SDK, but we're stuck on 1.0.5 because 1.0.6 and above require
`numpy<2.0.0`.
This leaves us with several choices of resolution, some of which are:
1. Downgrade `numpy` to upgrade `label_studio_sdk` to >=1.0.10 to
resolve the CVE
2. Drop `label_studio_sdk` by either removing or rewriting the test.
3. Drop test and dev dependencies from the `unstructured` image.
We've decided to do 2. _and_ 3. This PR handles 2., with 3. to be a
follow-on PR.
Here we add a deprecation notice to `stage_for_label_studio` and remove
the offending test. Normally good practice would be to add a warning of
future deprecation to the function for a reasonable amount of time, but
in order to address the CVE immediately, we're deprecating it right
away.
### Testing
Install the dependencies \(`make install`\) into a fresh environment, and
`pip list | grep label` should have no results. The scan artifact in CI

**Summary**
In preparation for pluggable auto-partitioners simplify metadata as
discussed.
**Additional Context**
- Pluggable auto-partitioners requires partitioners to have a consistent
call signature. An arbitrary partitioner provided at runtime needs to
have a call signature that is known and consistent. Basically
`partition_x\(filename, *, file, **kwargs\)`.
- The current `auto.partition\(\)` is highly coupled to each distinct
file-type partitioner, deciding which arguments to forward to each.
- This is driven by the existence of "delegating" partitioners, those
that convert their file-type and then call a second partitioner to do
the actual partitioning. Both the delegating and proxy partitioners are
decorated with metadata-post-processing decorators and those decorators
are not idempotent. We call the situation where those decorators would
run twice "double-decorating". For example, EPUB converts to HTML and
calls `partition_html\(\)` and both `partition_epub\(\)` and
`partition_html\(\)` are decorated.
- The way double-decorating has been avoided in the past is to avoid
sending the arguments the metadata decorators are sensitive to to the
proxy partitioner. This is very obscure, complex to reason about,
error-prone, and just overall not a viable strategy. The better solution
is to not decorate delegating partitioners and let the proxy partitioner
handle all the metadata.
- This first step in preparation for that is part of simplifying the
metadata processing by removing unused or unwanted legacy parameters.
- `date_from_file_object` is a misnomer because a file-object never
contains last-modified data.
- It can never produce useful results in the API where last-modified
information must be provided by `metadata_last_modified`.
- It is an undocumented parameter so not in use.
- Using it can produce incorrect metadata.")[#3655](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured/pull/3655)[)](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured/commit/3bab9d93e60a968edaebd68b15ac997c4671990c "rfctr\(part\): prepare for pluggable auto-partitioners 1 \(#3655\)

### Summary
Table OCR refactor, move the OCR part for table model in inference repo
to unst repo.
* Before this PR, table model extracts OCR tokens with texts and
bounding box and fills the tokens to the table structure in inference
repo. This means we need to do an additional OCR for tables.
* After this PR, we use the OCR data from entire page OCR and pass the
OCR tokens to inference repo, which means we only do one OCR for the
entire document.
**Tech details:**
* Combined env `ENTIRE_PAGE_OCR` and `TABLE_OCR` to `OCR_AGENT`, this
means we use the same OCR agent for entire page and tables since we only
do one OCR.
* Bump inference repo to `0.7.9`, which allow table model in inference
to use pre-computed OCR data from unst repo. Please check in
\[PR\]\(https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured-inference/pull/256\).
* All notebooks lint are made by `make tidy`
* This PR also fixes
\[issue\]\(https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured/issues/1564\),
I've added test for the issue in
`test_pdf.py::test_partition_pdf_hi_table_extraction_with_languages`
* Add same scaling logic to image \[similar to previous Table
OCR\]\(https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured-inference/blob/main/unstructured_inference/models/tables.py#L109C1-L113\),
but now scaling is applied to entire image
### Test
* Not much to manually testing expect table extraction still works
* But due to change on scaling and use pre-computed OCR data from entire
page, there are some slight \(better\) changes on table output, here is an
comparison on test outputs i found from the same test
`test_partition_image_with_table_extraction`:

### TODO
\(added as a ticket\) Still have some clean up to do in inference repo
since now unst repo have duplicate logic, but can keep them as a fall
back plan. If we want to remove anything OCR related in inference, here
are items that is deprecated and can be removed:
*
\[`get_tokens`\]\(https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured-inference/blob/main/unstructured_inference/models/tables.py#L77\)
\(already noted in code\)
* parameter `extract_tables` in inference
*
\[`interpret_table_block`\]\(https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured-inference/blob/main/unstructured_inference/inference/layoutelement.py#L88\)
*
\[`load_agent`\]\(https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured-inference/blob/main/unstructured_inference/models/tables.py#L197\)
* env `TABLE_OCR` 
### Note
if we want to fallback for an additional table OCR \(may need this for
using paddle for table\), we need to:
* pass `infer_table_structure` to inference with `extract_tables`
parameter
* stop passing `infer_table_structure` to `ocr.py`

Removed the dependencies contained in `test.txt`, `dev.txt`, and
`constraints.txt` from the things that get installed in the docker
image. In order to keep testing the image \(running the tests\), I added a
step to the `docker-test` make target to install `test.txt` and
`dev.txt`. Thus we presumably get a smaller image \(probably not much
smaller\), reduce the dependency chain or our images, and have less
exposure to vulnerabilities while still testing as robustly as before.
Incidentally, I removed the `Dockerfile` for our ubuntu image, since it
made reference to non-existent make targets, which tells me it's stale
and wasn't being used.

Adds a CI check to ensure that packages added as dependencies are
appropriately licensed. All of the `.txt` files in the `requirements`

conditions on the other dependency files
- `dev.txt`, since those are for local development and not shipped as
part of the `unstructured` package
- `extra-pdf-image.txt` - the `extra-pdf-image.in` since checking
`extra-pdf-image.txt` pulls in NVIDIA GPU related packages with an

those without adding `Other/Proprietary` to the allowed licenses list.

Open-Source Pre-Processing Tools for Unstructured Data
[](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured/#--open-source-pre-processing-tools-for-unstructured-data)
The `unstructured` library provides open-source components for ingesting and pre-processing images and text documents, such as PDFs, HTML, Word docs, and [many more](https://docs.unstructured.io/open-source/core-functionality/partitioning). The use cases of `unstructured` revolve around streamlining and optimizing the data processing workflow for LLMs. `unstructured` modular functions and connectors form a cohesive system that simplifies data ingestion and pre-processing, making it adaptable to different platforms and efficient in transforming unstructured data into structured outputs.
## Try the Unstructured Serverless API!
[](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured/#try-the-unstructured-serverless-api)
Looking for better pre-processing performance and less setup? Check out our new [Serverless API](https://unstructured.io/api-key-hosted)! The Unstructured Serverless API is our most performant API yet, delivering a more responsive, production-grade solution to better support your business and LLM needs. Head to our [signup page](https://app.unstructured.io/) page to get started for free.
## â´ï¸ Quick Start
[](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured/#eight_pointed_black_star-quick-start)
There are several ways to use the `unstructured` library:
  * [Run the library in a container](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured#run-the-library-in-a-container) or
  * Install the library 
    1. [Install from PyPI](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured#installing-the-library)
    2. [Install for local development](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured#installation-instructions-for-local-development)
  * For installation with `conda` on Windows system, please refer to the [documentation](https://unstructured-io.github.io/unstructured/installing.html#installation-with-conda-on-windows)


### Run the library in a container
[](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured/#run-the-library-in-a-container)
The following instructions are intended to help you get up and running using Docker to interact with `unstructured`. See [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) if you don't already have docker installed on your machine.
NOTE: we build multi-platform images to support both x86_64 and Apple silicon hardware. `docker pull` should download the corresponding image for your architecture, but you can specify with `--platform` (e.g. `--platform linux/amd64`) if needed.
We build Docker images for all pushes to `main`. We tag each image with the corresponding short commit hash (e.g. `fbc7a69`) and the application version (e.g. `0.5.5-dev1`). We also tag the most recent image with `latest`. To leverage this, `docker pull` from our image repository.
```
docker pull downloads.unstructured.io/unstructured-io/unstructured:latest
```

Once pulled, you can create a container from this image and shell to it.
```
# create the container
docker run -dt --name unstructured downloads.unstructured.io/unstructured-io/unstructured:latest
# this will drop you into a bash shell where the Docker image is running
docker exec -it unstructured bash
```

You can also build your own Docker image. Note that the base image is `wolfi-base`, which is updated regularly. If you are building the image locally, it is possible `docker-build` could fail due to upstream changes in `wolfi-base`.
If you only plan on parsing one type of data you can speed up building the image by commenting out some of the packages/requirements necessary for other data types. See Dockerfile to know which lines are necessary for your use case.
```
make docker-build
# this will drop you into a bash shell where the Docker image is running
make docker-start-bash
```

Once in the running container, you can try things directly in Python interpreter's interactive mode.
```
# this will drop you into a python console so you can run the below partition functions
python3
>>> from unstructured.partition.pdf import partition_pdf
>>> elements = partition_pdf(filename="example-docs/layout-parser-paper-fast.pdf")
>>> from unstructured.partition.text import partition_text
>>> elements = partition_text(filename="example-docs/fake-text.txt")
```

  * Install the Python SDK to support all document types with `pip install "unstructured[all-docs]"`
    * For plain text files, HTML, XML, JSON and Emails that do not require any extra dependencies, you can run `pip install unstructured`
    * To process other doc types, you can install the extras required for those documents, such as `pip install "unstructured[docx,pptx]"`
  * Install the following system dependencies if they are not already available on your system. Depending on what document types you're parsing, you may not need all of these.
    * `libmagic-dev` (filetype detection)
    * `poppler-utils` (images and PDFs)
    * `tesseract-ocr` (images and PDFs, install `tesseract-lang` for additional language support)
    * `libreoffice` (MS Office docs)
    * `pandoc` (EPUBs, RTFs and Open Office docs). Please note that to handle RTF files, you need version `2.14.2` or newer. Running either `make install-pandoc` or `./scripts/install-pandoc.sh` will install the correct version for you.
  * For suggestions on how to install on the Windows and to learn about dependencies for other features, see the installation documentation [here](https://unstructured-io.github.io/unstructured/installing.html).


At this point, you should be able to run the following code:
```
from unstructured.partition.auto import partition
elements = partition(filename="example-docs/eml/fake-email.eml")
print("\n\n".join([str(el) for el in elements]))
```

### Installation Instructions for Local Development
[](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured/#installation-instructions-for-local-development)
The following instructions are intended to help you get up and running with `unstructured` locally if you are planning to contribute to the project.
  * Using `pyenv` to manage virtualenv's is recommended but not necessary
    * Mac install instructions. See [here](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/community#mac--homebrew) for more detailed instructions. 
      * `brew install pyenv-virtualenv`
      * `pyenv install 3.10`
    * Linux instructions are available [here](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/community#linux).
  * Create a virtualenv to work in and activate it, e.g. for one named `unstructured`:
`pyenv virtualenv 3.10 unstructured` `pyenv activate unstructured`
  * Run `make install`
  * Optional:
    * To install models and dependencies for processing images and PDFs locally, run `make install-local-inference`.
    * For processing image files, `tesseract` is required. See [here](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/Installation.html) for installation instructions.
    * For processing PDF files, `tesseract` and `poppler` are required. The [pdf2image docs](https://pdf2image.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html) have instructions on installing `poppler` across various platforms.


Additionally, if you're planning to contribute to `unstructured`, we provide you an optional `pre-commit` configuration file to ensure your code matches the formatting and linting standards used in `unstructured`. If you'd prefer not to have code changes auto-tidied before every commit, you can use `make check` to see whether any linting or formatting changes should be applied, and `make tidy` to apply them.
If using the optional `pre-commit`, you'll just need to install the hooks with `pre-commit install` since the `pre-commit` package is installed as part of `make install` mentioned above. Finally, if you decided to use `pre-commit` you can also uninstall the hooks with `pre-commit uninstall`.
In addition to develop in your local OS we also provide a helper to use docker providing a development environment:
```
make docker-start-dev
```

This starts a docker container with your local repo mounted to `/mnt/local_unstructured`. This docker image allows you to develop without worrying about your OS's compatibility with the repo and its dependencies.

### PDF Document Parsing Example
[](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured/#pdf-document-parsing-example)
The following examples show how to get started with the `unstructured` library. The easiest way to parse a document in unstructured is to use the `partition` function. If you use `partition` function, `unstructured` will detect the file type and route it to the appropriate file-specific partitioning function. If you are using the `partition` function, you may need to install additional dependencies per doc type. For example, to install docx dependencies you need to run `pip install "unstructured[docx]"`. See our [installation guide](https://docs.unstructured.io/open-source/installation/full-installation) for more details.
```
from unstructured.partition.auto import partition
elements = partition("example-docs/layout-parser-paper.pdf")
```

Run `print("\n\n".join([str(el) for el in elements]))` to get a string representation of the output, which looks like:
```

LayoutParser : A Uniï¬ed Toolkit for Deep Learning Based Document Image Analysis
Zejiang Shen 1 ( (cid:0) ), Ruochen Zhang 2 , Melissa Dell 3 , Benjamin Charles Germain Lee 4 , Jacob Carlson 3 , and
Weining Li 5
Abstract. Recent advances in document image analysis (DIA) have been primarily driven by the application of neural
networks. Ideally, research outcomes could be easily deployed in production and extended for further investigation.
However, various factors like loosely organized codebases and sophisticated model conï¬gurations complicate the easy
reuse of important innovations by a wide audience. Though there have been ongoing eï¬orts to improve reusability and
simplify deep learning (DL) model development in disciplines like natural language processing and computer vision, none
of them are optimized for challenges in the domain of DIA. This represents a major gap in the existing toolkit, as DIA
is central to academic research across a wide range of disciplines in the social sciences and humanities. This paper
introduces LayoutParser, an open-source library for streamlining the usage of DL in DIA research and applications.
The core LayoutParser library comes with a set of simple and intuitive interfaces for applying and customizing DL models
for layout detection, character recognition, and many other document processing tasks. To promote extensibility,
LayoutParser also incorporates a community platform for sharing both pre-trained models and full document digitization
pipelines. We demonstrate that LayoutParser is helpful for both lightweight and large-scale digitization pipelines in
real-word use cases. The library is publicly available at https://layout-parser.github.io
