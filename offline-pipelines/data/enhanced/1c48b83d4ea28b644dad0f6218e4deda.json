The lower the loss, the better. The training process aims to minimize the loss. \n  * **Perplexity:** This is based on what the model estimates the probability of new data is. The lower the perplexity, the better. If the model is 100% correct at predicting the next token it will see, then the perplexity is 1. Mathematically this is calculated using entropy. \n  * **High-stakes settings:** Such as those identified as \"high-risk AI systems\" and \"unacceptable risk AI systems\" in the European Union's proposed [Artificial Intelligence (AI) Act](https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/annexes/).\n  * **Critical decisions:** Such as those defined in [the United States' proposed Algorithmic Accountability Act](https://www.congress.gov/117/bills/s3572/BILLS-117s3572is.pdf).\n  * **Human rights:** Includes those rights defined in the [Universal Declaration of Human Rights](https://www.un.org/sites/un2.un.org/files/2021/03/udhr.pdf).\n  * **Personal Data and Personal Information:** Personal data and information is defined in multiple data protection regulations, such as \"[personal data](https://gdpr-info.eu/issues/personal-data/)\" in the [European Union's General Data Protection Regulation](https://gdpr-info.eu); and \"personal information\" in the Republic of South Africa's [Protection of Personal Information Act](https://www.gov.za/sites/default/files/gcis_document/201409/3706726-11act4of2013popi.pdf), The People's Republic of China's [Personal information protection law](http://en.npc.gov.cn.cdurl.cn/2021-12/29/c_694559.htm).\n  * **Sensitive characteristics:** This includes specifically protected categories in human rights (see [UHDR, Article 2](https://www.un.org/sites/un2.un.org/files/2021/03/udhr.pdf)) and personal information regulation (see GDPR, [Article 9; Protection of Personal Information Act, Chapter 1](https://www.gov.za/sites/default/files/gcis_document/201409/3706726-11act4of2013popi.pdf))\n  * **Deception:** Doing something to intentionally mislead individuals to believe something that is false, such as by creating deadbots or chatbots on social media posing as real people, or generating text documents without making consumers aware that the text is machine generated.\n\n\n#  [ ](https://huggingface.co/bigscience/bloom/#more-information) More Information \n_This section provides links to writing on dataset creation, technical specifications, lessons learned, and initial results._\nClick to expand\n##  [ ](https://huggingface.co/bigscience/bloom/#intermediate-checkpoints) Intermediate checkpoints \nFor academic (or any) usage, we published the intermediate checkpoints, corresponding to the model state at each 5000 steps.
