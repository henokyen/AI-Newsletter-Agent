is a Python library that can help you extract tables from PDFs.\n**Extract tables from PDFs in just a few lines of code:**\nTry it yourself in our interactive quickstart notebook.

(As Tabula [explains](https://github.com/tabulapdf/tabula#why-tabula), \"If you can click and drag to select text in your table in a PDF viewer, then your PDF is text-based\".)\nYou can check out some frequently asked questions [here](https://camelot-py.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/faq.html).\n## Why Camelot?\n[](https://github.com/camelot-dev/camelot/#why-camelot)\n  * **Configurability** : Camelot gives you control over the table extraction process with [tweakable settings](https://camelot-py.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/advanced.html).\n  * **Metrics** : You can discard bad tables based on metrics like accuracy and whitespace, without having to manually look at each table.\n  * **Output** : Each table is extracted into a **pandas DataFrame** , which seamlessly integrates into [ETL and data analysis workflows](https://gist.github.com/vinayak-mehta/e5949f7c2410a0e12f25d3682dc9e873). You can also export tables to multiple formats, which include CSV, JSON, Excel, HTML, Markdown, and Sqlite.\n\n\nSee [comparison with similar libraries and tools](https://github.com/camelot-dev/camelot/wiki/Comparison-with-other-PDF-Table-Extraction-libraries-and-tools).\n## Installation\n[](https://github.com/camelot-dev/camelot/#installation)\n### Using conda\n[](https://github.com/camelot-dev/camelot/#using-conda)\nThe easiest way to install Camelot is with [conda](https://conda.io/docs/), which is a package manager and environment management system for the [Anaconda](http://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/) distribution.\n```\nconda install -c conda-forge camelot-py\n```\n\n### Using pip\n[](https://github.com/camelot-dev/camelot/#using-pip)\nAfter [installing the dependencies](https://camelot-py.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/install-deps.html) ([tk](https://packages.ubuntu.com/bionic/python/python-tk) and [ghostscript](https://www.ghostscript.com/)), you can also just use pip to install Camelot:\n```\npip install \"camelot-py[base]\"\n```\n\n### From the source code\n[](https://github.com/camelot-dev/camelot/#from-the-source-code)\nAfter [installing the dependencies](https://camelot-py.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/install.html#using-pip), clone the repo using:\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/camelot-dev/camelot.git\n```\n\nand install using pip:\n```\ncd camelot\npip install \".\"\n\n```\n\n## Documentation\n[](https://github.com/camelot-dev/camelot/#documentation)\nThe documentation is available at <http://camelot-py.readthedocs.io/>.\n## Wrappers\n[](https://github.com/camelot-dev/camelot/#wrappers)\n  * [camelot-php](https://github.com/randomstate/camelot-php) provides a [PHP](https://www.php.net/) wrapper on Camelot.\n\n\n## Related projects\n[](https://github.com/camelot-dev/camelot/#related-projects)\n  * [camelot-sharp](https://github.com/BobLd/camelot-sharp) provides a C sharp implementation of Camelot.\n\n\n## Contributing\n[](https://github.com/camelot-dev/camelot/#contributing)\nThe [Contributor's Guide](https://camelot-py.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dev/contributing.html) has detailed information about contributing issues, documentation, code, and tests.\n## Versioning\n[](https://github.com/camelot-dev/camelot/#versioning)\nCamelot uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).
