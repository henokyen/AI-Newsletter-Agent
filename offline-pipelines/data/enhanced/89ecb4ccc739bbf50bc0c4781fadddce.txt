# The Little Book of ML Metrics
[](https://github.com/NannyML/The-Little-Book-of-ML-Metrics/#the-little-book-of-ml-metrics)
Welcome to the open source repo of [The Little Book of ML Metrics](https://www.nannyml.com/metrics). The idea of the book is to be this little handbook that sits on every data scientist's desk for quick reference, from the most well-known metric, ahem, accuracy, to the most obscure ones (looking at you, P4 metric).
Tip
You can preview the latest pre-release version [here](https://github.com/NannyML/The-Little-Book-of-ML-Metrics/releases/download/nightly/main.pdf)
