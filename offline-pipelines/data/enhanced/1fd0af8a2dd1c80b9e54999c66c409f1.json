What's New (Dec, 2024)\n[](https://github.com/recommenders-team/recommenders/#whats-new-dec-2024)\nWe have a new release [Recommenders 1.2.1](https://github.com/recommenders-team/recommenders/releases/tag/1.2.1)!\nWe fixed a lot of bugs due to dependencies, improved security, reviewed the notebooks and the libraries.\n## Introduction\n[](https://github.com/recommenders-team/recommenders/#introduction)\nRecommenders objective is to assist researchers, developers and enthusiasts in prototyping, experimenting with and bringing to production a range of classic and state-of-the-art recommendation systems.\nRecommenders is a project under the [Linux Foundation of AI and Data](https://lfaidata.foundation/projects/).\nThis repository contains examples and best practices for building recommendation systems, provided as Jupyter notebooks. The examples detail our learnings on five key tasks:\n  * [Prepare Data](https://github.com/recommenders-team/recommenders/blob/main/examples/01_prepare_data): Preparing and loading data for each recommendation algorithm.\n  * [Model](https://github.com/recommenders-team/recommenders/blob/main/examples/00_quick_start): Building models using various classical and deep learning recommendation algorithms such as Alternating Least Squares ([ALS](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/_modules/pyspark/ml/recommendation.html#ALS)) or eXtreme Deep Factorization Machines ([xDeepFM](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.05170)).\n  * [Evaluate](https://github.com/recommenders-team/recommenders/blob/main/examples/03_evaluate): Evaluating algorithms with offline metrics.\n  * [Model Select and Optimize](https://github.com/recommenders-team/recommenders/blob/main/examples/04_model_select_and_optimize): Tuning and optimizing hyperparameters for recommendation models.\n  * [Operationalize](https://github.com/recommenders-team/recommenders/blob/main/examples/05_operationalize): Operationalizing models in a production environment on Azure.\n\n\nSeveral utilities are provided in [recommenders](https://github.com/recommenders-team/recommenders/blob/main/recommenders) to support common tasks such as loading datasets in the format expected by different algorithms, evaluating model outputs, and splitting training/test data. Implementations of several state-of-the-art algorithms are included for self-study and customization in your own applications. See the [Recommenders documentation](https://readthedocs.org/projects/microsoft-recommenders/).\nFor a more detailed overview of the repository, please see the documents on the [wiki page](https://github.com/microsoft/recommenders/wiki/Documents-and-Presentations).\nFor some of the practical scenarios where recommendation systems have been applied, see [scenarios](https://github.com/recommenders-team/recommenders/blob/main/scenarios).\n## Getting Started\n[](https://github.com/recommenders-team/recommenders/#getting-started)\nWe recommend [conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/glossary.html?highlight=environment#conda-environment) for environment management, and [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for development. To install the recommenders package and run an example notebook on Linux/WSL:\n```\n# 1. Install gcc if it is not installed already. On Ubuntu, this could done by using the command\n# sudo apt install gcc\n# 2. Create and activate a new conda environment\nconda create -n <environment_name> python=3.9\nconda activate <environment_name>\n# 3. Install the core recommenders package. It can run all the CPU notebooks.\npip install recommenders\n# 4. create a Jupyter kernel\npython -m ipykernel install --user --name <environment_name> --display-name <kernel_name>\n# 5. Clone this repo within VSCode or using command line:\ngit clone https://github.com/recommenders-team/recommenders.git\n# 6. Within VSCode:\n#  a. Open a notebook, e.g., examples/00_quick_start/sar_movielens.ipynb; \n#  b. Select Jupyter kernel <kernel_name>;\n#  c. Run the notebook.\n```\n\nFor more information about setup on other platforms (e.g., Windows and macOS) and different configurations (e.g., GPU, Spark and experimental features), see the [Setup Guide](https://github.com/recommenders-team/recommenders/blob/main/SETUP.md).\nIn addition to the core package, several extras are also provided, including:\n  * `[gpu]`: Needed for running GPU models.\n  * `[spark]`: Needed for running Spark models.\n  * `[dev]`: Needed for development for the repo.\n  * `[all]`: `[gpu]`|`[spark]`|`[dev]`\n  * `[experimental]`: Models that are not thoroughly tested and/or may require additional steps in installation.\n\n\n## Algorithms\n[](https://github.com/recommenders-team/recommenders/#algorithms)\nThe table below lists the recommendation algorithms currently available in the repository.

In this notebook, the MovieLens dataset is split into training/test sets at a 75/25 ratio using a stratified split. A recommendation model is trained using each of the collaborative filtering algorithms below. We utilize empirical parameter values reported in literature [here](http://mymedialite.net/examples/datasets.html). For ranking metrics we use `k=10` (top 10 recommended items). We run the comparison on a Standard NC6s_v2 [Azure DSVM](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/virtual-machines/data-science-virtual-machines/) (6 vCPUs, 112 GB memory and 1 P100 GPU). Spark ALS is run in local standalone mode.

Before contributing, please see our [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/recommenders-team/recommenders/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).\nThis project adheres to this [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/recommenders-team/recommenders/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) in order to foster a welcoming and inspiring community for all.\n## Build Status\n[](https://github.com/recommenders-team/recommenders/#build-status)\nThese tests are the nightly builds, which compute the asynchronous tests. `main` is our principal branch and `staging` is our development branch. We use [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/) for testing python utilities in [recommenders](https://github.com/recommenders-team/recommenders/blob/main/recommenders) and the Recommenders [notebook executor](https://github.com/recommenders-team/recommenders/blob/main/recommenders/utils/notebook_utils.py) for the [notebooks](https://github.com/recommenders-team/recommenders/blob/main/examples).\nFor more information about the testing pipelines, please see the [test documentation](https://github.com/recommenders-team/recommenders/blob/main/tests/README.md).\n### AzureML Nightly Build Status\n[](https://github.com/recommenders-team/recommenders/#azureml-nightly-build-status)\nThe nightly build tests are run daily on AzureML.\nBuild Type | Branch | Status | Branch | Status  \n---|---|---|---|---  \n**Linux CPU** | main | [![azureml-cpu-nightly](https://github.com/microsoft/recommenders/actions/workflows/azureml-cpu-nightly.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/microsoft/recommenders/actions/workflows/azureml-cpu-nightly.yml?query=branch%3Amain) | staging | [![azureml-cpu-nightly](https://github.com/microsoft/recommenders/actions/workflows/azureml-cpu-nightly.yml/badge.svg?branch=staging)](https://github.com/microsoft/recommenders/actions/workflows/azureml-cpu-nightly.yml?query=branch%3Astaging)  \n**Linux GPU** | main | [![azureml-gpu-nightly](https://github.com/microsoft/recommenders/actions/workflows/azureml-gpu-nightly.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/microsoft/recommenders/actions/workflows/azureml-gpu-nightly.yml?query=branch%3Amain) | staging | [![azureml-gpu-nightly](https://github.com/microsoft/recommenders/actions/workflows/azureml-gpu-nightly.yml/badge.svg?branch=staging)](https://github.com/microsoft/recommenders/actions/workflows/azureml-gpu-nightly.yml?query=branch%3Astaging)  \n**Linux Spark** | main | [![azureml-spark-nightly](https://github.com/microsoft/recommenders/actions/workflows/azureml-spark-nightly.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/microsoft/recommenders/actions/workflows/azureml-spark-nightly.yml?query=branch%3Amain) | staging | [![azureml-spark-nightly](https://github.com/microsoft/recommenders/actions/workflows/azureml-spark-nightly.yml/badge.svg?branch=staging)](https://github.com/microsoft/recommenders/actions/workflows/azureml-spark-nightly.yml?query=branch%3Astaging)  \n## References\n[](https://github.com/recommenders-team/recommenders/#references)\n  * **FREE COURSE** : M.
