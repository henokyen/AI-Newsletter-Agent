## What's New (Dec, 2024)
[](https://github.com/recommenders-team/recommenders/#whats-new-dec-2024)
We have a new release [Recommenders 1.2.1](https://github.com/recommenders-team/recommenders/releases/tag/1.2.1)!
We fixed a lot of bugs due to dependencies, improved security, reviewed the notebooks and the libraries.
## Introduction
[](https://github.com/recommenders-team/recommenders/#introduction)
Recommenders objective is to assist researchers, developers and enthusiasts in prototyping, experimenting with and bringing to production a range of classic and state-of-the-art recommendation systems.
Recommenders is a project under the [Linux Foundation of AI and Data](https://lfaidata.foundation/projects/).
This repository contains examples and best practices for building recommendation systems, provided as Jupyter notebooks. The examples detail our learnings on five key tasks:
  * [Prepare Data](https://github.com/recommenders-team/recommenders/blob/main/examples/01_prepare_data): Preparing and loading data for each recommendation algorithm.
  * [Model](https://github.com/recommenders-team/recommenders/blob/main/examples/00_quick_start): Building models using various classical and deep learning recommendation algorithms such as Alternating Least Squares ([ALS](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/_modules/pyspark/ml/recommendation.html#ALS)) or eXtreme Deep Factorization Machines ([xDeepFM](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.05170)).
  * [Evaluate](https://github.com/recommenders-team/recommenders/blob/main/examples/03_evaluate): Evaluating algorithms with offline metrics.
  * [Model Select and Optimize](https://github.com/recommenders-team/recommenders/blob/main/examples/04_model_select_and_optimize): Tuning and optimizing hyperparameters for recommendation models.
  * [Operationalize](https://github.com/recommenders-team/recommenders/blob/main/examples/05_operationalize): Operationalizing models in a production environment on Azure.


Several utilities are provided in [recommenders](https://github.com/recommenders-team/recommenders/blob/main/recommenders) to support common tasks such as loading datasets in the format expected by different algorithms, evaluating model outputs, and splitting training/test data. Implementations of several state-of-the-art algorithms are included for self-study and customization in your own applications. See the [Recommenders documentation](https://readthedocs.org/projects/microsoft-recommenders/).
For a more detailed overview of the repository, please see the documents on the [wiki page](https://github.com/microsoft/recommenders/wiki/Documents-and-Presentations).
For some of the practical scenarios where recommendation systems have been applied, see [scenarios](https://github.com/recommenders-team/recommenders/blob/main/scenarios).
## Getting Started
[](https://github.com/recommenders-team/recommenders/#getting-started)
We recommend [conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/glossary.html?highlight=environment#conda-environment) for environment management, and [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for development. To install the recommenders package and run an example notebook on Linux/WSL:
```
# 1. Install gcc if it is not installed already. On Ubuntu, this could done by using the command
# sudo apt install gcc
# 2. Create and activate a new conda environment
conda create -n <environment_name> python=3.9
conda activate <environment_name>
# 3. Install the core recommenders package. It can run all the CPU notebooks.
pip install recommenders
# 4. create a Jupyter kernel
python -m ipykernel install --user --name <environment_name> --display-name <kernel_name>
# 5. Clone this repo within VSCode or using command line:
git clone https://github.com/recommenders-team/recommenders.git
# 6. Within VSCode:
#  a. Open a notebook, e.g., examples/00_quick_start/sar_movielens.ipynb; 
#  b. Select Jupyter kernel <kernel_name>;
#  c. Run the notebook.
```

For more information about setup on other platforms (e.g., Windows and macOS) and different configurations (e.g., GPU, Spark and experimental features), see the [Setup Guide](https://github.com/recommenders-team/recommenders/blob/main/SETUP.md).
In addition to the core package, several extras are also provided, including:
  * `[gpu]`: Needed for running GPU models.
  * `[spark]`: Needed for running Spark models.
  * `[dev]`: Needed for development for the repo.
  * `[all]`: `[gpu]`|`[spark]`|`[dev]`
  * `[experimental]`: Models that are not thoroughly tested and/or may require additional steps in installation.

### Algorithm Comparison
[](https://github.com/recommenders-team/recommenders/#algorithm-comparison)
We provide a [benchmark notebook](https://github.com/recommenders-team/recommenders/blob/main/examples/06_benchmarks/movielens.ipynb) to illustrate how different algorithms could be evaluated and compared. In this notebook, the MovieLens dataset is split into training/test sets at a 75/25 ratio using a stratified split. A recommendation model is trained using each of the collaborative filtering algorithms below. We utilize empirical parameter values reported in literature [here](http://mymedialite.net/examples/datasets.html). For ranking metrics we use `k=10` (top 10 recommended items). We run the comparison on a Standard NC6s_v2 [Azure DSVM](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/virtual-machines/data-science-virtual-machines/) (6 vCPUs, 112 GB memory and 1 P100 GPU). Spark ALS is run in local standalone mode. In this table we show the results on Movielens 100k, running the algorithms for 15 epochs.
