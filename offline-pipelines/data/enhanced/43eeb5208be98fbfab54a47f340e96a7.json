Alright, every ML engineer has been there. You’re sitting in a meeting, and someone drops the classic, \"So… how long will it take to train this model?\" At first, I had no idea how to answer it, and when I tried finding answers, most articles threw a ton of jargon without giving me the actual numbers I needed. Frustrating, right? I decided to dig into it myself and figured out how to do a rough back-of-the-napkin calculation that actually works. Let’s break down the key stuff. 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗠𝗮𝘁𝗵: ([https://lnkd.in/dWvgWvXM](https://www.linkedin.com/redir/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Flnkd%2Ein%2FdWvgWvXM&urlhash=Tvqa&trk=public_post-text)) ▸ It’s all about FLOPs (floating point operations) and GPU power. Basically, you calculate how many FLOPs your model and data require, then divide it by how much power your GPU setup can handle. ▸ For example, the LLaMA 3.1 model has 405 billion parameters and was trained on 15.6 trillion tokens. In plain English: that means it needed 3.8 × 10²⁵ FLOPs to train (yep, that's an insane number). ▸ To train this beast, they used 16,000 H100 GPUs, each working at about 400 teraflops per second. But here’s the catch—not all GPUs run at full speed. In fact, in this case, the GPUs were running at 38% efficiency due to various network and memory bottlenecks. So, how long did it take to train? Let’s calculate it: 3.8 × 10²⁵ FLOPs ÷ 6.4 × 10¹⁸ FLOPs per second = 61 days But, What About the Cost? 💸 This part always gets me. It took 26 million GPU hours to train LLaMA 3.1. With each GPU costing about $2/hour, the total came out to $52 million! That’s not a typo. I know, it’s wild. 𝗦𝗼, 𝗛𝗼𝘄 𝗗𝗼 𝗬𝗼𝘂 𝗘𝘀𝘁𝗶𝗺𝗮𝘁𝗲 𝗬𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗢𝘄𝗻 𝗧𝗿𝗮𝗶𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗧𝗶𝗺𝗲? ✦ Total FLOPs – Calculate the size of your model (parameters) and multiply it by the size of your dataset (tokens). The formula’s in the images I shared. ✦ GPU FLOPs – Find out how many FLOPs your GPUs can handle (and be honest about that efficiency drop!). ✦ Do the division – FLOPs needed ÷ GPU power = training time. The cool part? Once you know how to calculate this, you stop guessing and start making solid predictions, avoiding those \"ummm, not sure\" moments with the team. Lessons from LLaMA 3 ⇉ If training a 405B parameter model takes 16,000 GPUs and 61 days, scaling up or down from there gets pretty straightforward. But be warned: don’t just trust theoretical max numbers for your hardware. Use the real-world throughput (MFU) you’re actually getting, or you’ll end up way off. ⇉ This method isn’t flawless, but it’s miles better than guessing. When you’re dropping millions on GPU hours, you definitely want more than a ballpark guess. Would love to hear your thoughts if you've run similar calculations or hit similar roadblocks! Let’s get a conversation going. 👇 [#LLMs](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Fllms&trk=public_post-text) [#DataScience](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Fdatascience&trk=public_post-text) [#ArtificialIntelligence](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Fartificialintelligence&trk=public_post-text)\n[ 446  ](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Elinkedin%2Ecom%2Fposts%2Fashishpatel2604_llms-datascience-artificialintelligence-activity-7257270599444512769-EaiW&trk=public_post_social-actions-reactions) [ 36 Comments ](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Elinkedin%2Ecom%2Fposts%2Fashishpatel2604_llms-datascience-artificialintelligence-activity-7257270599444512769-EaiW&trk=public_post_social-actions-comments)\n[ Like  ](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Elinkedin%2Ecom%2Fposts%2Fashishpatel2604_llms-datascience-artificialintelligence-activity-7257270599444512769-EaiW&trk=public_post_like-cta) [ Comment  ](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Elinkedin%2Ecom%2Fposts%2Fashishpatel2604_llms-datascience-artificialintelligence-activity-7257270599444512769-EaiW&trk=public_post_comment-cta)\nShare \n  * Copy\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Facebook\n  * Twitter\n\n\n[ ](https://at.linkedin.com/in/stefan-komornyik?trk=public_post_comment_actor-image)\n[ Stefan Komornyik ](https://at.linkedin.com/in/stefan-komornyik?trk=public_post_comment_actor-name)\n🚀 It is my mission to make time series data valuable 🚀 delivering scalable, Cloud-first solutions with on-prem flexibility for the energy sector, with 30+ years of experience in 100+ companies.\n5mo \n  * [ Report this comment ](https://www.linkedin.com/uas/login?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fposts%2Fashishpatel2604_llms-datascience-artificialintelligence-activity-7257270599444512769-EaiW&trk=public_post_comment_ellipsis-menu-semaphore-sign-in-redirect&guestReportContentType=COMMENT&_f=guest-reporting)\n\n\nThank you-Super interesting!

Do not even think to use 1/10 of the effort in the picture above.... the LLM economy is shaping the researchers in AI towards such systems.... problem is not AI ....problem is the economy scale that the FAANG are trying (succesfully) to bring forward : ))) Daniele\n[ Like  ](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Elinkedin%2Ecom%2Fposts%2Fashishpatel2604_llms-datascience-artificialintelligence-activity-7257270599444512769-EaiW&trk=public_post_comment_like) [ Reply  ](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Elinkedin%2Ecom%2Fposts%2Fashishpatel2604_llms-datascience-artificialintelligence-activity-7257270599444512769-EaiW&trk=public_post_comment_reply) [ 6 Reactions ](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Elinkedin%2Ecom%2Fposts%2Fashishpatel2604_llms-datascience-artificialintelligence-activity-7257270599444512769-EaiW&trk=public_post_comment_reactions) 7 Reactions \n[ ](https://www.linkedin.com/in/visinha?trk=public_post_comment_actor-image)\n[ Vishal Sinha ](https://www.linkedin.com/in/visinha?trk=public_post_comment_actor-name) 4mo \n  * [ Report this comment ](https://www.linkedin.com/uas/login?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fposts%2Fashishpatel2604_llms-datascience-artificialintelligence-activity-7257270599444512769-EaiW&trk=public_post_comment_ellipsis-menu-semaphore-sign-in-redirect&guestReportContentType=COMMENT&_f=guest-reporting)\n\n\nTY for sharing these details.

💡 Accurately calculating training time for LLMs has always been tricky, and it’s awesome to see a practical breakdown like this. 🔢 FLOPs and GPU throughput aren’t usually discussed in this level of detail—it’s refreshing to see the real-world math behind training something as massive as LLaMA 3.1. 🧠 The efficiency drop you highlighted is such a critical point. Many overlook how network and memory bottlenecks impact real-world GPU performance, and that 38% efficiency makes a big difference in cost and timelines. ⚙️💸 Also, $52 million in GPU hours is mind-blowing! 😲 It really emphasizes how planning and optimization are essential when training models at this scale. Knowing the true throughput you’re getting (instead of trusting theoretical max speeds) is key to avoiding costly surprises. 🏗️📉 I love the step-by-step approach for estimating your own training time—super helpful for anyone navigating those awkward “how long will this take?” moments. 😂 Thanks for sharing the formulas too, they’ll be a lifesaver for future projects. Looking forward to hearing more about others' experiences with training large models—these insights will definitely make our jobs a bit easier! 🙌 [#LLMs](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Fllms&trk=public_post-text) [#ArtificialIntelligence](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Fartificialintelligence&trk=public_post-text) [#DataScience](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Fdatascience&trk=public_post-text) [#MachineLearning](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Fmachinelearning&trk=public_post-text) [#GPU](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Fgpu&trk=public_post-text) [#ModelTraining](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Fmodeltraining&trk=public_post-text) [#AIInsights](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Faiinsights&trk=public_post-text) [#DeepLearning](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Fdeeplearning&trk=public_post-text) [#AIOptimization](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Faioptimization&trk=public_post-text)\n[ ](https://in.linkedin.com/in/ashishpatel2604?trk=public_post_reshare_feed-actor-image)\n[ Ashish Patel 🇮🇳 ](https://in.linkedin.com/in/ashishpatel2604?trk=public_post_reshare_feed-actor-name)\nSr AWS AI ML Solution Architect at IBM | Generative AI Expert Strategist | Author Hands-on Time Series Analytics with Python | IBM Quantum ML Certified | 12+ Years in AI | IIMA | 100k+Followers | 6x LinkedIn Top Voice | \n5mo \nTraining a 405B LLM took 16,000 GPUs and 61 days—here’s the real math behind it.

Meta's 405B model is not really meant for inferencing anyway. It serves as a \"teaching model\" that can distill its knowledge to smaller, more efficient models. This process, known as model distillation, allows for the creation of high-performing smaller models with synthetic training data that are more feasible for deployment. Then the small model can actually outperform many larger models. The GPU resources for distillation are a very small fraction of what would be required for training. The other alternatives for using your own data are RAG approaches, which are the most common and least GPU intensive. The questions will always be around what is the desired outcome? What are the steps to get there? What is involved in maintaining it? And what does the cost / benefit / constraint Venn diagram look like? Nutanix provides the easiest on-ramp for organizations to leverage their own data with Enterprise AI, using models that are best suited for your use case. They can be LLMs, or SLMs, distilled, or with RAG, or both.

Alright, every ML engineer has been there. You’re sitting in a meeting, and someone drops the classic, \"So… how long will it take to train this model?\" At first, I had no idea how to answer it, and when I tried finding answers, most articles threw a ton of jargon without giving me the actual numbers I needed. Frustrating, right? I decided to dig into it myself and figured out how to do a rough back-of-the-napkin calculation that actually works. Let’s break down the key stuff. 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗠𝗮𝘁𝗵: ([https://lnkd.in/dWvgWvXM](https://www.linkedin.com/redir/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Flnkd%2Ein%2FdWvgWvXM&urlhash=Tvqa&trk=public_post_reshare-text)) ▸ It’s all about FLOPs (floating point operations) and GPU power. Basically, you calculate how many FLOPs your model and data require, then divide it by how much power your GPU setup can handle. ▸ For example, the LLaMA 3.1 model has 405 billion parameters and was trained on 15.6 trillion tokens. In plain English: that means it needed 3.8 × 10²⁵ FLOPs to train (yep, that's an insane number). ▸ To train this beast, they used 16,000 H100 GPUs, each working at about 400 teraflops per second. But here’s the catch—not all GPUs run at full speed. In fact, in this case, the GPUs were running at 38% efficiency due to various network and memory bottlenecks. So, how long did it take to train? Let’s calculate it: 3.8 × 10²⁵ FLOPs ÷ 6.4 × 10¹⁸ FLOPs per second = 61 days But, What About the Cost? 💸 This part always gets me. It took 26 million GPU hours to train LLaMA 3.1. With each GPU costing about $2/hour, the total came out to $52 million! That’s not a typo. I know, it’s wild. 𝗦𝗼, 𝗛𝗼𝘄 𝗗𝗼 𝗬𝗼𝘂 𝗘𝘀𝘁𝗶𝗺𝗮𝘁𝗲 𝗬𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗢𝘄𝗻 𝗧𝗿𝗮𝗶𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗧𝗶𝗺𝗲? ✦ Total FLOPs – Calculate the size of your model (parameters) and multiply it by the size of your dataset (tokens). The formula’s in the images I shared. ✦ GPU FLOPs – Find out how many FLOPs your GPUs can handle (and be honest about that efficiency drop!). ✦ Do the division – FLOPs needed ÷ GPU power = training time. The cool part? Once you know how to calculate this, you stop guessing and start making solid predictions, avoiding those \"ummm, not sure\" moments with the team. Lessons from LLaMA 3 ⇉ If training a 405B parameter model takes 16,000 GPUs and 61 days, scaling up or down from there gets pretty straightforward. But be warned: don’t just trust theoretical max numbers for your hardware. Use the real-world throughput (MFU) you’re actually getting, or you’ll end up way off. ⇉ This method isn’t flawless, but it’s miles better than guessing. When you’re dropping millions on GPU hours, you definitely want more than a ballpark guess. Would love to hear your thoughts if you've run similar calculations or hit similar roadblocks!

A significant run-time bottleneck of multi-GPU training is observed during model synchronization. Consider data parallelism, which: - Replicates the model across all GPUs. - Divides the available data into smaller batches, and each batch is processed by a separate GPU. - Computes the gradients on each GPU and then communicates them to every other GPU. Since every GPU processes a different chunk of the data, the gradients will also be different across devices. Thus, before updating the model parameters on each GPU device, local gradients must be communicated to all other devices. I covered two strategies for intermediate-sized models in yesterday's issue of the [Daily Dose of Data Science](https://in.linkedin.com/company/daily-dose-of-ds?trk=public_post-text) newsletter: [https://lnkd.in/g56-7HsZ](https://www.linkedin.com/redir/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Flnkd%2Ein%2Fg56-7HsZ&urlhash=JNnU&trk=public_post-text). 1) All-reduce: - One way is to transfer gradient from every GPU to every other GPU (naive approach). - Another way is to transfer gradients to one GPU, average them, and communicate back to all GPUs (better but not fully optimal and scalable). 2) Ring reduce: - While the total transfers are the same as the second procedure above, ring-reduce is much more scalable and efficient. - It does this with a ring formulation, then segments the local gradients on each device and transfers a segment to the next GPU. We covered it in detail here: [https://lnkd.in/g56-7HsZ](https://www.linkedin.com/redir/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Flnkd%2Ein%2Fg56-7HsZ&urlhash=JNnU&trk=public_post-text). 👉 Over to you: Can you optimize ring-reduce even further?\n[ 107  ](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fposts%2Favi-chawla_how-to-synchronize-gpus-with-multi-gpu-training-activity-7222547319672463360-uXQ-&trk=public_post_social-actions-reactions)\n[ Like  ](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fposts%2Favi-chawla_how-to-synchronize-gpus-with-multi-gpu-training-activity-7222547319672463360-uXQ-&trk=public_post_like-cta) [ Comment  ](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fposts%2Favi-chawla_how-to-synchronize-gpus-with-multi-gpu-training-activity-7222547319672463360-uXQ-&trk=public_post_comment-cta)\nShare \n    * Copy\n    * LinkedIn\n    * Facebook\n    * Twitter\nTo view or add a comment, [sign in](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fposts%2Favi-chawla_how-to-synchronize-gpus-with-multi-gpu-training-activity-7222547319672463360-uXQ-&trk=public_post_feed-cta-banner-cta)\n  * [](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/mazadgole_back-of-the-envelope-calculation-for-gpu-activity-7209639861891317761-VmX7)\n[ ](https://ca.linkedin.com/in/mazadgole?trk=public_post_feed-actor-image)\n[ Mehdi Azad ](https://ca.linkedin.com/in/mazadgole?trk=public_post_feed-actor-name)\nMachine Learning | Robotics | Educator \n9mo  Edited \n    * [ Report this post ](https://www.linkedin.com/uas/login?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fposts%2Fmazadgole_back-of-the-envelope-calculation-for-gpu-activity-7209639861891317761-VmX7&trk=public_post_ellipsis-menu-semaphore-sign-in-redirect&guestReportContentType=POST&_f=guest-reporting)\nI'm sure that when you want to work with LLMs, these questions come to mind: 1- How many GPUs are required to store and fine-tune LLMs? (Given an NVIDIA V100 GPU with 32GB memory) 2- How long did it take to pre-train LLMs? 3- How can compute-efficient methods, such as quantization or LoRA, reduce the GPU requirements ? To answer the questions, let's do a simple math: \"Storage\": 1 parameter = 4 bytes. A model with 1B parameters requires 4 GB of memory. With 1 GPU (32 GB), I can perform inference using a model with up to 8 billion parameters. (I can do better with quantization method.) For GPT-3 with 175B parameters, you need ~22 GPUs for just storing the weights. \"Fine-Tuning\": Considering overheads (gradients and optimizer states), fine-tuning GPT-3 requires approximately x6 times more memory than just storing the weights, around 132 GPUs. So I need ~100 more GPUs for full fine tuning. Good news: with LoRA you can to the fine tuning in just 1 GPU!!! \"Pre-training\": What about pre-training GPT-3 on a vast amount of data? How many GPUs do I need, and how long does it take? The answer is ~1000 GPUs running for 30 days. Can I do better?? Yes. You can see my simple calculations and interesting results in this blog post.

The approach I most often see non-experts take is to look up FLOP/s for the GPUs and then divide that by the FLOP per forward pass. E.g. The A100 is listed at 312 teraflop per second on its spec sheet (FP16 tensor), and a forward pass of GPT-4 requires 5.6e11 FLOP per forward pass, which would be 560 per second. But this turns out to be way too high. Even if spec sheet efficiency could be achieved (it can't), the model parameters also need to pass through the GPU's memory. The A100 only has 2000 GB/s of memory bandwidth – only enough for 4 forward passes! But that turns out to be way too low. In reality, multiple GPUs are parallelised and forward passes are processed in batches. This means real world efficiency is somewhere between these upper and lower bounds. Semianalysis estimates for GPT-4 on A100s, it's around 10x the lower bound and 10% of the upper. In the full post, I extend this to more advanced chips, and speculate about it might change in the future: [https://lnkd.in/e5DNbZDK](https://www.linkedin.com/redir/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Flnkd%2Ein%2Fe5DNbZDK&urlhash=8KaZ&trk=public_post-text)\n## [ How much AI inference can we do?  benjamintodd.substack.com  ](https://www.linkedin.com/redir/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Fbenjamintodd%2Esubstack%2Ecom%2Fp%2Fhow-much-ai-inference-can-we-do&urlhash=QrZ1&trk=public_post_feed-article-content)\n[ 6  ](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fposts%2Fbenjamin-j-todd_how-much-ai-inference-can-we-do-activity-7195268236697915393-SFAH&trk=public_post_social-actions-reactions)\n[ Like  ](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fposts%2Fbenjamin-j-todd_how-much-ai-inference-can-we-do-activity-7195268236697915393-SFAH&trk=public_post_like-cta) [ Comment  ](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fposts%2Fbenjamin-j-todd_how-much-ai-inference-can-we-do-activity-7195268236697915393-SFAH&trk=public_post_comment-cta)\nShare \n    * Copy\n    * LinkedIn\n    * Facebook\n    * Twitter\nTo view or add a comment, [sign in](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fposts%2Fbenjamin-j-todd_how-much-ai-inference-can-we-do-activity-7195268236697915393-SFAH&trk=public_post_feed-cta-banner-cta)\n  * [](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/marek-bar%C3%A1k-31977a55_cutlass-tutorial-persistent-kernels-and-activity-7276513592210821120-tuTT)\n[ ](https://at.linkedin.com/in/marek-bar%C3%A1k-31977a55?trk=public_post_feed-actor-image)\n[ Marek Barák ](https://at.linkedin.com/in/marek-bar%C3%A1k-31977a55?trk=public_post_feed-actor-name)\nData Alchemist & code:Breaker \n3mo \n    * [ Report this post ](https://www.linkedin.com/uas/login?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fposts%2Fmarek-bar%25C3%25A1k-31977a55_cutlass-tutorial-persistent-kernels-and-activity-7276513592210821120-tuTT&trk=public_post_ellipsis-menu-semaphore-sign-in-redirect&guestReportContentType=POST&_f=guest-reporting)\nAgain an resource that can be ignored, especially if you are in GPU programming, the skill of 2025+.

This last installment explains the Stream-K algorithm for scheduling work over threadblocks and how it surmounts the problem of wave quantization. To explain the problem, consider a naive \"data-parallel\" approach to GEMM that partitions the output matrix as a grid of tiles and assigns tiles to threadblocks one-to-one. A discrete number of waves will be launched to process the computation, quantized according to the total number of streaming multiprocessors (SMs). If the number of tiles is then not evenly divisible by the number of SMs, the last tail wave will process a reduced number of work tiles while still taking the time of a full wave, severely degrading overall TFLOPS performance. Roughly speaking, Stream-K addresses this issue by introducing parallelism along the inner K-dimension and enabling threadblocks to \"fractionally\" process output tiles, rebalancing the distribution of total work across the SMs. Our tutorial also describes CUTLASS's tile scheduler abstraction, which we leverage to effectively implement scheduling strategies like Stream-K. This separates scheduling optimizations that work at the grid level from those that target the inner load and compute loops, like the pipelining and warp specialization strategies we discussed in part 2 of this series. We both implement a simplified version of the Stream-K tile scheduler for a custom GEMM kernel and discuss the inner workings of CUTLASS's more advanced version.
