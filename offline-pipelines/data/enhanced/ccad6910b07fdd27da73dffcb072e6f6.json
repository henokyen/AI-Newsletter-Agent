You can launch a cluster in less than a minute. Scales to **hundreds of million of operations per second**. There are no other existing managed databases available today that can do this.\n## **Scale-Out**\nScales linearly with mores CPUs on a single host and/or scale-out by adding new data nodes.\n## **Battle tested**\nAn open-source distribution of NDB Cluster by Mikael Ronström, the inventor of NDB Cluster. \n## **Fastest**\nThroughput of up to hundreds of millions of read or write ops/seconds and <1ms latency for individual operations.\n## **SQL Support**\nAccess using the MySQL Server API for full compatibility with SQL. Native support for parallelizing queries.\n![LATS diagram](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6013cab68382f702f5481fa8/6034ee493af24635ef60fb45_venn-04.png)\n## **The first LATS databasein the cloud.**\nRonDB has dedicated support for features required for a high performance online feature store, including **LATS** : low **L** atency, high **A** vailability, high **T** hroughput, scalable **S** torage. RonDB is built with online feature stores in mind providing key capabilities that are unmatched.‍**< 1ms KV lookup>10M KV Lookups/sec>99.999% availability **\n[Learn More](https://www.rondb.com/about)\n## Contact us\n[![Logical Clocks Icon](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6013cab68382f702f5481fa8/621f2cc6b7c4660b4ec3c146_Hopsworks%20Icon%20White%20.png)](https://www.hopsworks.ai/)\nPowered by Hopsworks © RonDB 2025.
