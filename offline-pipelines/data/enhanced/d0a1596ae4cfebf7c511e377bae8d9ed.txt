  * ![A colorful, hand-drawn, cartoon-style illustration set against a vibrant blue background. In the center stands a cute, vintage-style robot with a white body and red accents \(shoulders, hands, waist, and feet\). Above the robot's head are three speech bubbles. The left bubble is orange and contains the text "EN" in bold black letters, representing English. The center bubble is white with the Chinese character "中" \(for Chinese\), and the right bubble is yellow with the Japanese character "日" \(for Japanese\). The robot appears to be choosing or processing languages, symbolizing multilingual communication or translation.](https://towardsdatascience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/article-cover-robot-ratio.png)
