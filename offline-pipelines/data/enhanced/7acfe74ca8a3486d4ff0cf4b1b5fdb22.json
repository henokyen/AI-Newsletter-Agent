This approach can be problematic for applications needing quick responses or those on devices with limited resources.\nImagine a self-driving car waiting for a cloud server to decide which lane to switch into—not ideal!\n**Edge AI solves this by bringing the AI capabilities directly to the device itself.**\n## Become an ML Scientist \nUpskill in Python to become a machine learning scientist.\n[Start Learning for Free](https://www.datacamp.com/tracks/machine-learning-scientist-with-python)\n## What Is Edge AI?\nEdge AI is the practice of deploying AI models and algorithms directly on edge devices, which are devices located at the network's periphery, close to where data is generated and actions need to be taken.\nThese devices encompass a wide range, from powerful edge servers to resource-constrained IoT sensors, and include familiar examples like smartphones, smart home appliances, autonomous vehicles, and even industrial robots.\nRecent advancements in AI, such as the development of smaller and more efficient language models like [GPT-4o Mini](https://www.datacamp.com/blog/gpt-4o-mini), [Llama 3.1 8B](https://www.datacamp.com/blog/llama-3-1-405b-meta-ai), and [Gemma 2 2B](https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/fine-tuning-gemma-2), are further accelerating the adoption of edge AI.\nThis shift to edge AI offers several advantages:\n  * Speed: Decisions and actions happen in real-time, right where the data is generated. This is necessary for applications like self-driving cars or medical devices that can't afford delays caused by sending data to the cloud for processing.\n  * Privacy: Sensitive data can be analyzed locally without needing to be sent to the cloud, enhancing security and privacy.\n  * Reliability: Edge AI reduces dependency on a constant internet connection, making it more reliable in areas with limited or unstable connectivity.\n  * Efficiency: Processing data locally reduces the bandwidth required to send everything to the cloud, saving both energy and costs.\n\n\n## How Edge AI Works\nTo understand how edge AI works, we need to understand its main components and the processes involved.\n### Key components\nEdge AI comprises three main components: edge devices, AI models, and communication.\n![Components of Edge AI](https://media.datacamp.com/legacy/v1723043761/image_a3d238bf5b.png)\n#### Edge devices\nEdge devices encompass a wide range of hardware, from powerful edge servers capable of handling substantial computational loads to highly resource-constrained IoT sensors designed for specific tasks.\nThese devices include smartphones, drones, autonomous vehicles, industrial robots, and smart home devices, all of which can run AI models locally to process data in real time. Some hardware manufacturers, like NVIDIA and Intel, even provide hardware support for [deploying ML models](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/mlops-deployment-and-life-cycling) on the edge.\n#### AI models\nEdge AI employs various types of AI models, including [machine learning](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/mlops-concepts), [deep learning](https://www.datacamp.com/tracks/deep-learning-in-python), and computer vision algorithms, optimized for efficient execution on edge devices.\nThese models are tailored to operate within the constraints of edge environments, ensuring that they can perform effectively despite limited processing power, memory, and storage.\nFor instance, models like GPT-4o Mini and Llama 3.1 8B are specifically designed to be lightweight and efficient, making them suitable for edge deployments.\n#### Communication\nEfficient data exchange between edge devices and the cloud is facilitated by communication protocols such as MQTT and REST APIs. These protocols enable seamless connectivity and data transfer, allowing synchronized operations between edge devices and central systems when necessary. These protocols allow the transfer of information in compressed form in an almost lossless fashion to keep the crucial information intact.\nMQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport)is a lightweight messaging protocol designed for constrained devices and low-bandwidth, high-latency, or unreliable networks. It uses a publish-subscribe model, allowing devices to send (publish) and receive (subscribe) messages without needing a direct connection. This makes MQTT ideal for IoT applications where devices need to communicate efficiently and reliably.\nREST API (Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface)is an architectural style for designing networked applications. It uses HTTP requests to access and use data. REST APIs are stateless, meaning each call from a client to a server must contain all the information the server needs to fulfill that request. This makes REST APIs scalable and suitable for various web services and applications, including those involving edge devices.\n### The Process\nThe workflow that powers edge AI involves three steps: data collection, data processing, and action.\n![Edge AI processes](https://media.datacamp.com/legacy/v1723043760/image_51de06a284.png)\n#### Data collection\nEdge devices continuously collect data from sensors, cameras, or other sources, providing a steady stream of information. This data can range from environmental metrics and health parameters to video feeds and audio recordings, forming the basis for real-time analysis.\nA great example of data collection is how your smartwatch collects the number of steps you took today.\n#### Data processing\nAI models deployed on edge devices process the collected data locally. This step involves analyzing the data to extract meaningful insights, detect patterns, and make predictions using AI models without relying on cloud resources.\nLocal processing ensures that decisions can be made quickly, such as a self-driving car determining which lane to choose in real-time.\n#### Real-Time Action\nBased on the AI model's output, edge devices can take immediate action. These actions might include triggering alarms, adjusting the path, or sending data to the cloud for further analysis. The ability to act in real-time is essential for scenarios requiring instant responses, such as security systems or medical devices.\n## Real-World Applications of Edge AI\nEdge AI is transforming various industries by enabling real-time intelligence and decision-making.
