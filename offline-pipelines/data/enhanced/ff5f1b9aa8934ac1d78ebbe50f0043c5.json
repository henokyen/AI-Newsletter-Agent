However, standard RAG systems employing simple semantic search often lack efficiency and precision when dealing with extensive data repositories. Hybrid search, on the other hand, combines the strengths of different search methods, unlocking new levels of efficiency and accuracy. **Hybrid search is flexible and can be adapted to tackle a wider range of information needs**.\nHybrid search can also be paired with **semantic reranking** (to reorder outcomes) to further enhance performance. Combining hybrid search with reranking holds immense potential for various applications, including natural language processing tasks like question answering and text summarization, even for implementation at a large-scale.\nIn our article, we'll delve into the nuances and limitations of hybrid search and reranking. Though pure vector search is preferable, in many cases hybrid search can enhance the retrieval component in **[RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)](https://superlinked.com/vectorhub/optimizing-rag-with-hybrid-search-and-reranking/retrieval-augmented-generation)** , and thereby deliver impactful and insightful text generation across various domains.\n## What is Hybrid Search?\nIn current Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, word embeddings are used to represent data in the vector database, and vector similarity search is commonly used for searching through them. For LLMs and RAG systems, embeddings - because they capture semantic relationships between words - are generally preferred over keyword-based representations like Bag-of-words (BoW) approaches.\nBut each of vector similarity search and keyword search has its own strengths and weaknesses. Vector similarity search is good, for example, at dealing with queries that contain typos, which usually don’t change the overall intent of the sentence. However, vector similarity search is not as good at precise matching on keywords, abbreviations, and names, which can get lost in vector embeddings along with the surrounding words. Here, keyword search performs better.\nThat being said, keyword search is not as good as vector similarity search at fetching relevant results based on semantic relationships or meaning, which are only available via word embeddings. For example, a keyword search will relate the words _“the river bank”_ and _“the Bank of America”_ even though there is no actual semantic connection between the terms - a difference to which vector similarity search is sensitive. Keyword search would, therefore, benefit from vector search, but the prevailing approach is not to combine them but rather to implement them separately using distinct methodologies.\n**In hybrid search - a keyword-sensitive semantic search approach, we combine vector search and keyword search algorithms to **[ **take advantage of their respective strengths while mitigating their respective limitations**](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/ai-azure-ai-services-blog/azure-ai-search-outperforming-vector-search-with-hybrid/ba-p/3929167).\n## Use cases for Hybrid Search\nVector similarity search proves to be inadequate in certain scenarios, including:\n  * Matching abbreviations like GAN or LLaMA in the query and knowledge base.\n  * Identifying exact words of names or objects, like “Biden” or “Salvador Dali\".\n  * Identifying exact code snippets in programming languages. (Taking a similarity search approach in such instances is practically useless.)\n\n\nIn such instances, hybrid search is extremely useful. Keyword search guarantees that abbreviations, annotations, names, and code stay on the radar, while vector search ensures that search results are contextually relevant. The new Stack Overflow, for example, has adopted just such an approach.\nStack Overflow has moved from simple lexical search to semantic and hybrid search, leveraging AI to make its search algorithms more powerful. Their earlier approach, which used the [TF-IDF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf) algorithm to match on user search string keywords - including exact code snippets, could miss posts that were relevant but didn't contain those exact keywords. Stack Overflow's new hybrid search methodology finds semantically relevant content from their corpus, and also matches the exact code entered by the user if necessary. This [significantly improved Stack Overflow's search results](https://stackoverflow.blog/2023/07/31/ask-like-a-human-implementing-semantic-search-on-stack-overflow/?source=post_page-----c75203c2f2f5--------------------------------).\n## Some limitations\nWhile hybrid search confers advantages in many use cases, it is not a silver bullet. It has limitations, including:\n  * **Latency** : Hybrid search involves performing two search algorithms, so it may be slower than a semantic search when executing on a large knowledge corpus.\n  * **Computational Expense** : Developing and customizing models for hybrid search can be computationally expensive. It's best to consider hybrid search only if your system requires keyword-backed results.\n  * **Native Support in Databases** : Not all vector databases support hybrid search. You need to ensure the vector database you choose does.\n\n\nThat being said, there _are_ many vector databases that incorporate functions that implement hybrid search - e.g., Pinecone, ElasticSearch, Apache Cassandra, and Weaviate. Check out the [Vector DB Comparison table](https://vdbs.superlinked.com/) to see which vector databases support hybrid search.\n## Implementation Architecture\n![Hybrid Search Architecture](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/superlinked/VectorHub/main/docs/assets/use_cases/hybrid_search_&_rerank_rag/HybridSearch.png)\nThe hybrid search algorithm combines keyword search and vector search to retrieve relevant content from a corpus. Let's take a look at the **components that make up the architecture of hybrid search**.\n### Keyword Search\n**Sparse vectors** are vectors with high dimensionality, where most elements are zero. They usually symbolize various language tokens, non-zero values signifying their respective importance. Keyword search is also called **sparse vector search**. The **BM25 (Best Match 25)** algorithm is a popular and effective ranking function employed for keyword matching in embeddings. BM25 finds the most relevant documents for a given query by examining two things:\n  * How often do the query words appear in each document? (the more, the better)\n  * How rare are the query words across all the documents? (the rarer, the better)\n\n\nThe BM25 score for document **D** for query **Q** is calculated as the sum of the scores for individual query terms. Here's the formula for calculating the BM25 score:\n**BM25(D, Q) = ∑(IDF(q) * ((TF(q, D) * (k1 + 1)) / (TF(q, D) + k1 * (1 — b + b * (|D| / avgdl)))))**\nwhere,\n  * **IDF(q)** denotes inverse document frequency\n  * **TF(q,D)** denotes term frequency\n  * **|D|** is the document length\n  * **avgdl** is the average document length\n  * **k1** and **b** are tunable constants\n\n\nNotice that the BM25 algorithm is a refined version of the [TF-IDF(Term-Frequency Inverse-Document Frequency)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf) algorithm.\n### Vector Search\n**Dense vectors, or embeddings** are arrays with a high number of dimensions, filled predominantly with meaningful, non-zero values. Machine learning frequently employs these to represent the underlying semantics and connections of words in a numerical format, thereby effectively encapsulating their semantic essence. Dense vector search is a method used in semantic search systems for finding similar items in a vector space.\nA common approach to vector search is [cosine similarity search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine_similarity). Cosine similarity is calculated as the result of the dot product of the vectors, normalized by the multiplication of their magnitudes. The nearer the outcome is to 1, the more similar the vectors are.\n**C(A,B) = cos(θ) = A.B / ||A|| ||B||**\n### Combination\nThe results from each algorithm have to be fused to implement a hybrid search. There are various strategies to combine them and get a score. To balance the keyword search score and vector search score to meet our requirements, we use the following formula:\n**H = (1-α) K + αV**\nwhere,\n  * **H** is the hybrid search score\n  * **α** is the weighted parameter\n  * **K** is the keyword search score\n  * **V** is the vector search score\n\n\nThe hybrid score is a pure vector score when α is 1, and a pure keyword score when α is 0.\n**Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF)** is one of several available methods for combining dense and sparse search scores. RRF ranks each passage according to its place in the keyword and vector outcome lists, and then merges these rankings to generate a unified result list. The RRF score is determined by summing the inverse rankings from each list. Positioning the document’s rank in the denominator imposes a penalty on documents that appear lower in the list.\n![Reciprocal Rank Fusion Equation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/superlinked/VectorHub/main/docs/assets/use_cases/hybrid_search_&_rerank_rag/RRF.png)\nwhere,\n  * **D** represents the set of documents\n  * **k** is a constant\n  * **r(d)** is the rank of document d\n\n\n### Reranking\n![Reranking Diagram](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/superlinked/VectorHub/main/docs/assets/use_cases/hybrid_search_&_rerank_rag/Rerank.png)\nTypically, algorithms yield top-k matches. But these top-k matches may not always include the relevant sections, or, conversely, not all relevant sections may be within these top-k matches. We can ameliorate this issue by ranking all retrieved content based on a score indicating semantic relevance to the query.\nTo do this, responses from the retriever must be passed to a **semantic scoring model**. Semantic scoring models are transformer models that take in queries and documents to produce a score in a calibrated range. This reranking process returns a list of documents, sorted according to relevance score, from highest to lowest, and incorporated into the response payload of the query.\n## Implementation Example\nLet’s test the performance of a normal vector search algorithm and a hybrid search algorithm in various contexts. We will be using [ChromaDB](https://www.trychroma.com/) supported by [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/) and models from HuggingFace. ChromaDB has no direct implementations for hybrid search, but for clarity, we will create an ensemble in the same way we discussed in the theory.\nFirst, we install and import the required libraries.\n```\n\n!pip install langchain langchain-community rank_bm25 pypdf unstructured chromadb\n!pip install unstructured['pdf'] unstructured\n!apt-get install poppler-utils\n!apt-get install -y tesseract-ocr\n!apt-get install -y libtesseract-dev\n!pip install pytesseract\n!pip install bitsandbytes accelerate peft safetensors sentencepiece\n\n```\n\nNext, we load our document and split it into chunks of the required size.\n```\n\nfrom langchain.document_loaders import UnstructuredPDFLoader\nfrom langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter\nfrom langchain.vectorstores import Chroma\n\nfrom langchain.embeddings import HuggingFaceInferenceAPIEmbeddings\nfrom langchain.llms import HuggingFaceHub\nimport torch\nfrom transformers import( AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer, BitsAndBytesConfig, pipeline,)from langchain import HuggingFacePipeline\n\nfrom langchain.retrievers import BM25Retriever, EnsembleRetriever\n\nimport os\n\n```\n\nNow, we load the PDF document and split it into chunks of the desired length with sufficient overlap. In this step, you can adjust the chunk size based on the length of your document and the requirements of your LLM.\n```\n\ndoc_path =\"/content/document.pdf\"file= UnstructuredPDFLoader(doc_path)docs =file.load()\n\n```\n```\n\n# create chunkssplitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=200,                     chunk_overlap=30)chunks = splitter.split_documents(docs)\n\n```\n\nNext, we create a vector store using the embeddings we obtain from the text.\n```\n\nembeddings = HuggingFaceInferenceAPIEmbeddings(  api_key=HF_TOKEN, model_name=\"BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5\")vectorstore = Chroma.from_documents(chunks, embeddings)\n\n```\n\nNow, we build the keyword and semantic retrievers separately. For keyword matching, we use the [BM25 retriever](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/retrievers/bm25) from Langchain. By setting k to 3, we’re asking the retriever to return the 3 most relevant documents or vectors from the vector store.\n```\n\nvectorstore_retreiver = vectorstore.as_retriever(search_kwargs={\"k\":3})keyword_retriever = BM25Retriever.from_documents(chunks)keyword_retriever.k =3\n\n```\n\nNow, we create the ensemble retriever, which is a weighted combination of the keyword and semantic retrievers above.\n```\n\nensemble_retriever = EnsembleRetriever(retrievers=[vectorstore_retreiver,                          keyword_retriever],                    weights=[0.3,0.7])\n\n```\n\nWe can modify the **weights** parameter to balance the impact of both search outcomes appropriately as needed. The weight values correspond to **α** and **1-α** , as we discussed above. Here, we have weighted keywords more heavily, with a value of 0.7.\nOur RAG pipeline needs an LLM. We utilize a quantized version of [Zephyr-7B-Beta](http://HuggingFaceH4/zephyr-7b-beta) for lightweight and optimized performance.\n```\n\nmodel_name =\"HuggingFaceH4/zephyr-7b-beta\"\n# function for loading 4-bit quantized modeldefload_quantized_model(model_name:str):\"\"\"\n  model_name: Name or path of the model to be loaded.\n  return: Loaded quantized model.\n  \"\"\"  bnb_config = BitsAndBytesConfig(    load_in_4bit=True,    bnb_4bit_use_double_quant=True,    bnb_4bit_quant_type=\"nf4\",    bnb_4bit_compute_dtype=torch.bfloat16,)\n  model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(    model_name,    load_in_4bit=True,    torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16,    quantization_config=bnb_config,)return model\n\n# initializing tokenizerdefinitialize_tokenizer(model_name:str):\"\"\"\n  model_name: Name or path of the model for tokenizer initialization.\n  return: Initialized tokenizer.\n  \"\"\"  tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name, return_token_type_ids=False)  tokenizer.bos_token_id =1# Set beginning of sentence token idreturn tokenizer\n\ntokenizer = initialize_tokenizer(model_name)\nmodel = load_quantized_model(model_name)# specify stop token idsstop_token_ids =[0]\n# build huggingface pipeline for using zephyr-7b-betapipeline = pipeline(\"text-generation\",  model=model,  tokenizer=tokenizer,  use_cache=True,  device_map=\"auto\",  max_length=2048,  do_sample=True,  top_k=5,  num_return_sequences=1,  eos_token_id=tokenizer.eos_token_id,  pad_token_id=tokenizer.pad_token_id,)\nllm = HuggingFacePipeline(pipeline=pipeline)\n\n```\n\nNow, we define the hybrid search and semantic search retrievers.\n```\n\nfrom langchain.chains import RetrievalQA\n\nnormal_chain = RetrievalQA.from_chain_type(  llm=llm, chain_type=\"stuff\", retriever=vectorstore_retreiver\n)\nhybrid_chain = RetrievalQA.from_chain_type(  llm=llm, chain_type=\"stuff\", retriever=ensemble_retriever\n)response = PREFFERED_CHAIN.invoke(\"QUERY\")\n\n```\n\nLet’s check responses from both retrievers in various contexts. First, we will **query in a general context without keywords, abbreviations, or location filters**.\n```\n\nQuery: What are the two strategic challenges that the United States faces according to the National Security Strategy?\n\nSemantic Search\nResult: According to the given context, the United States faces two strategic challenges as stated in the 2022 National Security Strategy. The challenges are that the post-Cold War era is over, and a competition is underway between major powers to shape what comes next.\nHybrid Search\nResult: According to the 2022 National Security Strategy, the United States faces two strategic challenges: the end of the post-Cold War era and a competition underway between major powers to shape what comes next, and the recognition that the democratic allies and partners in the Indo-Pacific and Europe are mutually reinforcing and intertwined fates.\n\n```\n\nBoth results are somewhat accurate and satisfactory. Now, let us try again, **this time incorporating abbreviations and name filters** to see how that works.\n```\n\nQuery: How did Joe Biden help deepen NATO relationship?\n\nSemantic Search\nResult: Under Joe Biden's leadership, America has deepened its relationship with NATO by responding to global challenges and strengthening NATO, making it stronger and more united than it has ever been, as we look to continue promoting stability, prosperity, and growth.\nHybrid Search\nResult: Under Joe Biden's leadership, the United States has worked to deepen NATO's relationship through various means. First, he has emphasized the importance of NATO's collective defense commitment, reiterating that the United States will defend every inch of NATO territory, which has helped build trust and confidence among alliance members. Second, Biden has played a key role in modernizing NATO's strategies and capabilities to address emerging threats, such as cyber-attacks and hybrid warfare. Third, he has prioritized engagement with key NATO partners, such as Sweden and Finland, to broaden and deepen the transatlantic bond. Fourth, Biden has advocated for increased funding and resources for NATO, which has helped strengthen the alliance's military and economic capabilities. Overall, Biden's efforts have contributed to a more cohesive and effective NATO, which is better equipped to address global challenges and opportunities.\n\n```\n\nThe results of the hybrid search are more detailed, provide a more comprehensive response, including the names of countries and other specific information. Now, **let’s add specific locations to see how each approach fares**.\n```\n\nQuery: How is Strait of Hormuz important in Biden's strategy?\n\nSemantic Search\nResult: The passage doesn't explicitly state how the Strait of Hormuz is important in Biden's strategy. However, it does mention that the United States and its allies have a shared responsibility to maintain a free and open Indo-Pacific, which includes protecting the freedom of navigation. It is possible that preserving freedom of navigation in this area is also a part of Biden's overall strategy for the region.\nHybrid Search\nResult: Biden's strategy emphasizes the importance of ensuring freedom of navigation through the Strait of Hormuz, a waterway located in the Middle East. This strategy aims to prevent any country from dominating the region through military efforts and ensures that there are no efforts to control the waterways. This emphasis on freedom of navigation is crucial for the United States and its allies as a significant portion of the world's oil supply passes through this waterway. Any disruption or control of this waterway could have significant economic and geopolitical implications, making Biden's strategy to maintain this freedom critical.\n\n```\n\nThe hybrid search appears to perform better in providing a specific and detailed response to the query, whereas the semantic search produced a more generalized interpretation without explicitly addressing the importance of the Strait of Hormuz and a geographical overview of the place.\n### Other database options\nOur implementation example above uses ChromaDB. Your use case may warrant using a different database. Other databases, for example, [Weaviate DB](https://weaviate.io/), **offer native support and implementation for hybrid search**. Here's how you would define the retriever component for hybrid search in Weaviate DB.\n```\n\nfrom langchain.retrievers.weaviate_hybrid_search import WeaviateHybridSearchRetriever\n\nretriever = WeaviateHybridSearchRetriever(  alpha =0.5,# defaults to 0.5, which is equal weighting between keyword and semantic search  client = client,# keyword arguments to pass to the Weaviate client  index_name =\"\",# The name of the index to use  text_key =\"\",# The name of the text key to use  attributes =[],# The attributes to return in the results)hybrid_chain = RetrievalQA.from_chain_type(  llm=llm, chain_type=\"stuff\", retriever=retriever\n)\n\n```\n\nThe value of the **alpha** parameter in the Weaviate retriever can be adjusted to control the relative impact of semantic and keyword searches.\nBecause the retrievers created above score the top k responses internally and return the highest-scoring response, we may not always need to perform reranking explicitly. In the event of low accuracy in the retrieved content, you can implement a reranker directly using libraries from Cohere, or build your own custom reranking function. When using a reranker from [Cohere](https://cohere.com/rerank), the following changes should be made in the retriever.\n```\n\nfrom langchain.retrievers import ContextualCompressionRetriever\nfrom langchain.retrievers.document_compressors import CohereRerank\ncompressor = CohereRerank()compression_retriever = ContextualCompressionRetriever(  base_compressor=compressor, base_retriever=ensemble_retriever\n)hybrid_chain = RetrievalQA.from_chain_type(  llm=llm, chain_type=\"stuff\", retriever=compression_retriever\n)\n\n```\n\n## Conclusion\nWe've looked at how RAG system performance can be enhanced by using hybrid search along with reranking, as compared with using keyword search or vector search on their own. By combining keyword and vector search into one hybrid method, we can match on keywords in contextually relevant content, achieving more refined responses. Using hybrid search, the retriever's higher recall rates permit the LLM to produce higher-quality outputs.\n## Contributors\n  * [Ashish Abraham, author](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ashish-abraham-811a23201/)\n  * [Mór Kapronczay, contributor](https://www.linkedin.com/in/m%C3%B3r-kapronczay-49447692)\n  * [Robert Turner, editor](https://robertturner.co/copyedit)\n\n\n![](https://superlinked.com/vectorhub/_next/static/media/thick-arrow.99bec954.svg)\nStay updated with VectorHub\nSubscribe\n![arrow](https://superlinked.com/vectorhub/_next/static/media/thick-arrow.99bec954.svg)\nContinue Reading\n![](https://innovative-ants-bf39f838ee.media.strapiapp.com/research_agent_3a22caf3b8.png)\n#Superlinked\nSimplifying Complex Research with AI\nLearn how to build an AI research assistant that finds, summarizes, and answers questions about scie...\nMarch 24, 2025\n![](https://innovative-ants-bf39f838ee.media.strapiapp.com/vector_indexing_8463f7f6de.png)\n#RAG\n#Vector Search\nVector Indexes\nVector indexes are crucial to efficient, relevant, and accurate search in various common application...\nAugust 14, 2024\n![](https://innovative-ants-bf39f838ee.media.strapiapp.com/rag_feedback_878ba93f75.png)\n#RAG\nYour RAG application is a communication system\nEffective RAG can take the best features of language models and moderate their shortcomings.
