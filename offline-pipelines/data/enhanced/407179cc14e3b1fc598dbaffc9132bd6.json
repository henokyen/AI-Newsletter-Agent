The last version to support Python 3.8 - 3.9 was [0.2.6](https://pypi.org/project/gpt-engineer/0.2.6/).\n### Setup API key\n[](https://github.com/gpt-engineer-org/gpt-engineer/#setup-api-key)\nChoose **one** of:\n  * Export env variable (you can add this to .bashrc so that you don't have to do it each time you start the terminal) \n    * `export OPENAI_API_KEY=[your api key]`\n  * .env file: \n    * Create a copy of `.env.template` named `.env`\n    * Add your OPENAI_API_KEY in .env\n  * Custom model: \n    * See [docs](https://gpt-engineer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/open_models.html), supports local model, azure, etc.\n\n\nCheck the [Windows README](https://github.com/AntonOsika/gpt-engineer/blob/main/WINDOWS_README.md) for Windows usage.\n**Other ways to run:**\n  * Use Docker ([instructions](https://github.com/AntonOsika/gpt-engineer/blob/main/docker/README.md))\n  * Do everything in your browser: [![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://github.com/gpt-engineer-org/gpt-engineer/codespaces)\n\n\n### Create new code (default usage)\n[](https://github.com/gpt-engineer-org/gpt-engineer/#create-new-code-default-usage)\n  * Create an empty folder for your project anywhere on your computer\n  * Create a file called `prompt` (no extension) inside your new folder and fill it with instructions\n  * Run `gpte <project_dir>` with a relative path to your folder \n    * For example: `gpte projects/my-new-project` from the gpt-engineer directory root with your new folder in `projects/`\n\n\n### Improve existing code\n[](https://github.com/gpt-engineer-org/gpt-engineer/#improve-existing-code)\n  * Locate a folder with code which you want to improve anywhere on your computer\n  * Create a file called `prompt` (no extension) inside your new folder and fill it with instructions for how you want to improve the code\n  * Run `gpte <project_dir> -i` with a relative path to your folder \n    * For example: `gpte projects/my-old-project -i` from the gpt-engineer directory root with your folder in `projects/`\n\n\n### Benchmark custom agents\n[](https://github.com/gpt-engineer-org/gpt-engineer/#benchmark-custom-agents)\n  * gpt-engineer installs the binary 'bench', which gives you a simple interface for benchmarking your own agent implementations against popular public datasets.\n  * The easiest way to get started with benchmarking is by checking out the [template](https://github.com/gpt-engineer-org/gpte-bench-template) repo, which contains detailed instructions and an agent template.\n  * Currently supported benchmark: \n    * [APPS](https://github.com/hendrycks/apps)\n    * [MBPP](https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/mbpp)\n\n\nThe community has started work with different benchmarking initiatives, as described in [this Loom](https://www.loom.com/share/206805143fbb4302b5455a5329eaab17?sid=f689608f-8e49-44f7-b55f-4c81e9dc93e6) video.\n### Research\n[](https://github.com/gpt-engineer-org/gpt-engineer/#research)\nSome of our community members have worked on different research briefs that could be taken further. See [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qmOj2DvdPc6syIAm8iISZFpfik26BYw7ZziD5c-9G0E/edit?usp=sharing) if you are interested.\n## Terms\n[](https://github.com/gpt-engineer-org/gpt-engineer/#terms)\nBy running gpt-engineer, you agree to our [terms](https://github.com/gpt-engineer-org/gpt-engineer/blob/main/TERMS_OF_USE.md).\n## Relation to gptengineer.app (GPT Engineer)\n[](https://github.com/gpt-engineer-org/gpt-engineer/#relation-to-gptengineerapp-gpt-engineer)\n[gptengineer.app](https://gptengineer.app/) is a commercial project for the automatic generation of web apps. It features a UI for non-technical users connected to a git-controlled codebase. The gptengineer.app team is actively supporting the open source community.\n## Features\n[](https://github.com/gpt-engineer-org/gpt-engineer/#features)\n### Pre Prompts\n[](https://github.com/gpt-engineer-org/gpt-engineer/#pre-prompts)\nYou can specify the \"identity\" of the AI agent by overriding the `preprompts` folder with your own version of the `preprompts`. You can do so via the `--use-custom-preprompts` argument.\nEditing the `preprompts` is how you make the agent remember things between projects.\n### Vision\n[](https://github.com/gpt-engineer-org/gpt-engineer/#vision)\nBy default, gpt-engineer expects text input via a `prompt` file. It can also accept image inputs for vision-capable models. This can be useful for adding UX or architecture diagrams as additional context for GPT Engineer. You can do this by specifying an image directory with the `—-image_directory` flag and setting a vision-capable model in the second CLI argument.\nE.g. `gpte projects/example-vision gpt-4-vision-preview --prompt_file prompt/text --image_directory prompt/images -i`\n### Open source, local and alternative models\n[](https://github.com/gpt-engineer-org/gpt-engineer/#open-source-local-and-alternative-models)\nBy default, gpt-engineer supports OpenAI Models via the OpenAI API or Azure OpenAI API, as well as Anthropic models.\nWith a little extra setup, you can also run with open source models like WizardCoder. See the [documentation](https://gpt-engineer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/open_models.html) for example instructions.\n## Mission\n[](https://github.com/gpt-engineer-org/gpt-engineer/#mission)\nThe gpt-engineer community mission is to **maintain tools that coding agent builders can use and facilitate collaboration in the open source community**.\nIf you are interested in contributing to this, we are interested in having you.\nIf you want to see our broader ambitions, check out the [roadmap](https://github.com/gpt-engineer-org/gpt-engineer/blob/main/ROADMAP.md), and join [discord](https://discord.gg/8tcDQ89Ej2) to learn how you can [contribute](https://github.com/AntonOsika/gpt-engineer/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) to it.\ngpt-engineer is [governed](https://github.com/gpt-engineer-org/gpt-engineer/blob/main/GOVERNANCE.md) by a board of long-term contributors. If you contribute routinely and have an interest in shaping the future of gpt-engineer, you will be considered for the board.\n## Significant contributors\n[](https://github.com/gpt-engineer-org/gpt-engineer/#significant-contributors)\n  * [ ![@ATheorell](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/143704446?s=64&v=4) @ATheorell ](https://github.com/ATheorell)\n  * [ ![@similato87](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/71301573?s=64&v=4) @similato87 ](https://github.com/similato87)\n  * [ ![@TheoMcCabe](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9841960?s=64&v=4) @TheoMcCabe ](https://github.com/TheoMcCabe)\n  * [ ![@captivus](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/366332?s=64&v=4) @captivus ](https://github.com/captivus)\n\n\n## Example\n[](https://github.com/gpt-engineer-org/gpt-engineer/#example)\nreduced.mov\n## About\nCLI platform to experiment with codegen.
