These devices include smartphones, drones, autonomous vehicles, industrial robots, and smart home devices, all of which can run AI models locally to process data in real time. Some hardware manufacturers, like NVIDIA and Intel, even provide hardware support for [deploying ML models](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/mlops-deployment-and-life-cycling) on the edge.
#### AI models
Edge AI employs various types of AI models, including [machine learning](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/mlops-concepts), [deep learning](https://www.datacamp.com/tracks/deep-learning-in-python), and computer vision algorithms, optimized for efficient execution on edge devices.
These models are tailored to operate within the constraints of edge environments, ensuring that they can perform effectively despite limited processing power, memory, and storage.
For instance, models like GPT-4o Mini and Llama 3.1 8B are specifically designed to be lightweight and efficient, making them suitable for edge deployments.
#### Communication
Efficient data exchange between edge devices and the cloud is facilitated by communication protocols such as MQTT and REST APIs. These protocols enable seamless connectivity and data transfer, allowing synchronized operations between edge devices and central systems when necessary. These protocols allow the transfer of information in compressed form in an almost lossless fashion to keep the crucial information intact.
MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport)is a lightweight messaging protocol designed for constrained devices and low-bandwidth, high-latency, or unreliable networks. It uses a publish-subscribe model, allowing devices to send (publish) and receive (subscribe) messages without needing a direct connection. This makes MQTT ideal for IoT applications where devices need to communicate efficiently and reliably.
REST API (Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface)is an architectural style for designing networked applications. It uses HTTP requests to access and use data. REST APIs are stateless, meaning each call from a client to a server must contain all the information the server needs to fulfill that request. This makes REST APIs scalable and suitable for various web services and applications, including those involving edge devices.
### The Process
The workflow that powers edge AI involves three steps: data collection, data processing, and action.
![Edge AI processes](https://media.datacamp.com/legacy/v1723043760/image_51de06a284.png)
