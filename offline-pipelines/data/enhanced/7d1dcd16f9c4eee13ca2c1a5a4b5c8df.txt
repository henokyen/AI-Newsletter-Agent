# NVIDIA Merlin
NVIDIA Merlin™ is an open-source framework for building high-performing recommender systems at scale.
[Get Started](https://github.com/NVIDIA-Merlin/Merlin)
## Designed for Recommender Workflows
[NVIDIA Merlin](https://github.com/NVIDIA-Merlin/Merlin) empowers data scientists, machine learning engineers, and researchers to build high-performing recommenders at scale. Merlin includes libraries, methods, and tools that streamline the building of recommenders by addressing common preprocessing, feature engineering, training, inference, and deploying to production challenges. Merlin components and capabilities are optimized to support the retrieval, filtering, scoring, and ordering of hundreds of terabytes of data, all accessible through easy-to-use APIs. With Merlin, better predictions, increased click-through rates, and faster deployment to production are within reach.
![Diagram illustrating detailed components Recommender Workflows](https://d29g4g2dyqv443.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/akamai/merlin-detailed-diagram-850x480.jpg)
## Interoperable Solution
[NVIDIA Merlin](https://github.com/NVIDIA-Merlin/Merlin), as part of NVIDIA AI, advances our commitment to support innovative practitioners doing their best work. NVIDIA Merlin components are designed to be interoperable within existing recommender workflows that utilize data science, machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) on CPUs or GPUs. Data scientists, ML engineers, and researchers are able to use single or multiple components, or libraries, to accelerate the entire recommender pipeline—from ingesting, training, inference, to deploying to production. NVIDIA Merlin's open-source components simplify building and deploying a production-quality pipeline. 
### Merlin Models
[Merlin Models](https://github.com/NVIDIA-Merlin/models) is a library that provides standard models for recommender systems and high quality implementations from ML to more advanced DL models on CPUs and GPUs. Train models for retrieval and ranking within 10 lines of code.
