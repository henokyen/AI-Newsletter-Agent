This model was trained by [MosaicML](https://www.mosaicml.com).\nMPT-30B is part of the family of Mosaic Pretrained Transformer (MPT) models, which use a modified transformer architecture optimized for efficient training and inference.\nMPT-30B comes with special features that differentiate it from other LLMs, including an 8k token context window (which can be further extended via finetuning; see [MPT-7B-StoryWriter](https://huggingface.co/mosaicml/mpt-7b-storywriter)), support for context-length extrapolation via [ALiBi](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.12409), and efficient inference + training via FlashAttention. It also has strong coding abilities thanks to its pretraining mix. MPT models can also be served efficiently with both standard HuggingFace pipelines and NVIDIA's [FasterTransformer](https://github.com/NVIDIA/FasterTransformer). The size of MPT-30B was also specifically chosen to make it easy to deploy on a single GPU—either 1xA100-80GB in 16-bit precision or 1xA100-40GB in 8-bit precision.\nThis model uses the MosaicML LLM codebase, which can be found in the [llm-foundry repository](https://github.com/mosaicml/llm-foundry). It was trained by MosaicML’s NLP team on the [MosaicML platform](https://www.mosaicml.com/training) for LLM pretraining, finetuning, and inference.\n###  [ ](https://huggingface.co/mosaicml/mpt-30b/#how-is-this-model-different) How is this model different? \nMPT-30B is:\n  * **Licensed for the possibility of commercial use** (unlike [LLaMA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13971)).\n  * **Trained on a large amount of data** (1T tokens like [LLaMA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13971) vs. 300B for [Pythia](https://github.com/EleutherAI/pythia), 300B for [OpenLLaMA](https://github.com/openlm-research/open_llama), and 800B for [StableLM](https://github.com/Stability-AI/StableLM)).\n  * **Prepared to handle extremely long inputs** thanks to [ALiBi](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.12409).\n  * **Capable of fast training and inference** (via [FlashAttention](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.14135.pdf) and [FasterTransformer](https://github.com/NVIDIA/FasterTransformer))\n  * **Equipped with highly efficient open-source training code** via the [llm-foundry repository](https://github.com/mosaicml/llm-foundry)\n\n\n###  [ ](https://huggingface.co/mosaicml/mpt-30b/#models-finetuned-off-mpt-30b) Models finetuned off MPT-30B: \nThe following models are finetuned on MPT-30B:\n  * [MPT-30B-Instruct](https://huggingface.co/mosaicml/mpt-30b-instruct): a model for long-form instruction following (especially summarization and question-answering).

This is because we use a custom `MPT` model architecture that is not yet part of the Hugging Face `transformers` package. `MPT` includes options for many training efficiency features such as [FlashAttention](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.14135.pdf), [ALiBi](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.12409), [QK LayerNorm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.04245), and more.\nTo use the optimized [triton implementation](https://github.com/openai/triton) of FlashAttention, you can load the model on GPU (`cuda:0`) with `attn_impl='triton'` and with `bfloat16` precision:\n```\nimport torch\nimport transformers\nname = 'mosaicml/mpt-30b'\nconfig = transformers.AutoConfig.from_pretrained(name, trust_remote_code=True)\nconfig.attn_config['attn_impl'] = 'triton' # change this to use triton-based FlashAttention\nconfig.init_device = 'cuda:0' # For fast initialization directly on GPU!\nmodel = transformers.AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\n name,\n config=config,\n torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16, # Load model weights in bfloat16\n trust_remote_code=True\n)\n\n```\n\nThe model was trained initially with a sequence length of 2048 with an additional pretraining stage for sequence length adapation up to 8192. However, ALiBi enables users to increase the maximum sequence length even further during finetuning and/or inference. For example:\n```\nimport transformers\nname = 'mosaicml/mpt-30b'\nconfig = transformers.AutoConfig.from_pretrained(name, trust_remote_code=True)\nconfig.max_seq_len = 16384 # (input + output) tokens can now be up to 16384\nmodel = transformers.AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\n name,\n config=config,\n trust_remote_code=True\n)\n\n```\n\nThis model was trained with the MPT-30B tokenizer which is identical to the [EleutherAI/gpt-neox-20b](https://huggingface.co/EleutherAI/gpt-neox-20b) tokenizer.\n```\nfrom transformers import AutoTokenizer\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained('mosaicml/mpt-30b')\n\n```\n\nThe model can then be used, for example, within a text-generation pipeline.Note: when running Torch modules in lower precision, it is best practice to use the [torch.autocast context manager](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/amp.html).\n```\nfrom transformers import pipeline\nwith torch.autocast('cuda', dtype=torch.bfloat16):\n  inputs = tokenizer('Here is a recipe for vegan banana bread:\\n', return_tensors=\"pt\").to('cuda')\n  outputs = model.generate(**inputs, max_new_tokens=100)\n  print(tokenizer.batch_decode(outputs, skip_special_tokens=True))\n# or using the HF pipeline\npipe = pipeline('text-generation', model=model, tokenizer=tokenizer, device='cuda:0')\nwith torch.autocast('cuda', dtype=torch.bfloat16):\n  print(\n    pipe('Here is a recipe for vegan banana bread:\\n',\n      max_new_tokens=100,\n      do_sample=True,\n      use_cache=True))\n\n```\n\n##  [ ](https://huggingface.co/mosaicml/mpt-30b/#model-description) Model Description \nThe architecture is a modification of a standard decoder-only transformer.\nThe model has been modified from a standard transformer in the following ways:\n  * It uses [FlashAttention](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.14135.pdf)\n  * It uses [ALiBi (Attention with Linear Biases)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.12409) and does not use positional embeddings\n  * It does not use biases\n\n\nHyperparameter | Value  \n---|---  \nn_parameters | 29.95B  \nn_layers | 48  \nn_heads | 64  \nd_model | 7168  \nvocab size | 50432  \nsequence length | 8192  \n##  [ ](https://huggingface.co/mosaicml/mpt-30b/#training-data) Training Data \n###  [ ](https://huggingface.co/mosaicml/mpt-30b/#streaming-datasets) Streaming Datasets \nData was formatted using the MosaicML [StreamingDataset](https://github.com/mosaicml/streaming) library to host our data in object storage and efficiently stream it to our compute cluster during training. StreamingDataset obviates the need to download the whole dataset before starting training, and allows instant resumption of training from any point in the dataset.\n###  [ ](https://huggingface.co/mosaicml/mpt-30b/#data-mix) Data Mix \nThe model was trained for 1T tokens on the following data mix:\nData Source | Number of Tokens in Source | Proportion | Effective Number of Tokens | Epochs  \n---|---|---|---|---  \nmC4 3.1.0 - English (200+ words) | 2417.99 B | 33.50% | 335 B | 0.14  \nc4 - English - SemDedup 80% | 100.42 B | 29.90% | 299 B | 2.98  \nRedPajama - CommonCrawl | 878.45 B | 8.50% | 85 B | 0.097  \nThe Stack - Selected Languages | 463.78 B | 10.00% | 100 B | 0.22  \nRedPajama - Wikipedia | 4.87 B | 4.00% | 40 B | 8.21  \nThe Stack - Markdown | 107.07 B | 4.50% | 45 B | 0.42  \nSemantic Scholar ORC | 48.95 B | 3.30% | 33 B | 0.67  \nRedPajama - Books | 26.02 B | 3.00% | 30 B | 1.15  \nRedPajama - arXiv | 28.10 B | 1.90% | 19 B | 0.68  \nRedPajama - StackExchange | 20.54 B | 1.40% | 14 B | 0.68  \nSamples for each batch were selected from one of the datasets with the probability specified above. The examples were shuffled within each dataset, and each example was constructed from as many sequences from that dataset as were necessary to fill the sequence length. To build 8k support into MPT-30B efficiently, we first pre-trained on 1T tokens using sequences that were 2k tokens long, and then trained for an additional 50B tokens using sequences that were 8k tokens long.\nThe data was tokenized using the [EleutherAI/gpt-neox-20b](https://huggingface.co/EleutherAI/gpt-neox-20b) tokenizer. This BPE tokenizer has a number of desirable characteristics, most of which are relevant for tokenizing code: (1) It was trained on a diverse mix of data that includes code (The Pile) (2) It applies consistent space delimitation, unlike the GPT2 tokenizer which tokenizes inconsistently depending on the presence of prefix spaces (3) It contains tokens for repeated space characters, which allows superior compression of text with large amounts of repeated space characters.\nThe model vocabulary size of 50432 was set to be a multiple of 128 (as in [MEGATRON-LM](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.08053)).\n###  [ ](https://huggingface.co/mosaicml/mpt-30b/#training-configuration) Training Configuration \nThe model was trained in three stages using the [MosaicML Platform](https://www.mosaicml.com/platform): (i) First it was trained on 440 A100-40GBs with a batch size of 1760. (ii) Then, on 216 A100-40GBs with a batch size of 1728. (iii) Training was completed on 256 H100-80GBs with a batch size of 512 with 8k context length and 50B tokens. The model was trained with sharded data parallelism using [FSDP](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/fsdp.html) and used the [LION](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06675) optimizer.\n##  [ ](https://huggingface.co/mosaicml/mpt-30b/#limitations-and-biases) Limitations and Biases \n_The following language is modified from[EleutherAI's GPT-NeoX-20B](https://huggingface.co/EleutherAI/gpt-neox-20b)_\nMPT-30B (Base) is **not** intended for deployment without finetuning.
