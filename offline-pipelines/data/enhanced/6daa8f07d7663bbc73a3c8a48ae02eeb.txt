##### About the Database
The AI Incident Database is dedicated to indexing the collective history of harms or near harms realized in the real world by the deployment of artificial intelligence systems. Like similar databases in aviation and computer security, the AI Incident Database aims to learn from experience so we can prevent or mitigate bad outcomes.
You are invited to [submit](https://incidentdatabase.ai/apps/submit/) incident reports, whereupon submissions will be indexed and made [discoverable](https://incidentdatabase.ai/apps/discover/) to the world. Artificial intelligence will only be a benefit to people and society if we collectively record and learn from its failings. [(Learn More)](https://incidentdatabase.ai/about/)
