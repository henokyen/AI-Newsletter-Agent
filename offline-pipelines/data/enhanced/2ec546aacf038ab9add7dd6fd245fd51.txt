CuPy is a NumPy/SciPy-compatible array library for GPU-accelerated computing with Python. CuPy acts as a [drop-in replacement](https://docs.cupy.dev/en/stable/reference/comparison.html) to run existing NumPy/SciPy code on NVIDIA CUDA or AMD ROCm platforms.
```
>>> import cupy as cp
>>> x = cp.arange(6).reshape(2, 3).astype('f')
>>> x
array([[ 0., 1., 2.],
    [ 3., 4., 5.]], dtype=float32)
>>> x.sum(axis=1)
array([ 3., 12.], dtype=float32)
```

CuPy also provides access to low-level CUDA features. You can pass `ndarray` to existing CUDA C/C++ programs via [RawKernels](https://docs.cupy.dev/en/stable/user_guide/kernel.html#raw-kernels), use [Streams](https://docs.cupy.dev/en/stable/reference/cuda.html) for performance, or even call [CUDA Runtime APIs](https://docs.cupy.dev/en/stable/reference/cuda.html#runtime-api) directly.
## Installation
[](https://github.com/cupy/cupy/#installation)
### Pip
[](https://github.com/cupy/cupy/#pip)
Binary packages (wheels) are available for Linux and Windows on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/org/cupy/). Choose the right package for your platform.
Platform | Architecture | Command  
---|---|---  
CUDA 11.x (11.2+) | x86_64 / aarch64 | `pip install cupy-cuda11x`  
CUDA 12.x | x86_64 / aarch64 | `pip install cupy-cuda12x`  
ROCm 4.3 (_[experimental](https://docs.cupy.dev/en/latest/install.html#using-cupy-on-amd-gpu-experimental)_) | x86_64 | `pip install cupy-rocm-4-3`  
ROCm 5.0 (_[experimental](https://docs.cupy.dev/en/latest/install.html#using-cupy-on-amd-gpu-experimental)_) | x86_64 | `pip install cupy-rocm-5-0`  
Note
To install pre-releases, append `--pre -U -f https://pip.cupy.dev/pre` (e.g., `pip install cupy-cuda11x --pre -U -f https://pip.cupy.dev/pre`).
### Conda
[](https://github.com/cupy/cupy/#conda)
Binary packages are also available for Linux and Windows on [Conda-Forge](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/cupy).
Platform | Architecture | Command  
---|---|---  
CUDA | x86_64 / aarch64 / ppc64le | `conda install -c conda-forge cupy`  
If you need a slim installation (without also getting CUDA dependencies installed), you can do `conda install -c conda-forge cupy-core`.
If you need to use a particular CUDA version (say 12.0), you can use the `cuda-version` metapackage to select the version, e.g. `conda install -c conda-forge cupy cuda-version=12.0`.
Note
If you encounter any problem with CuPy installed from `conda-forge`, please feel free to report to [cupy-feedstock](https://github.com/conda-forge/cupy-feedstock/issues), and we will help investigate if it is just a packaging issue in `conda-forge`'s recipe or a real issue in CuPy.
### Docker
[](https://github.com/cupy/cupy/#docker)
Use [NVIDIA Container Toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/overview.html) to run [CuPy container images](https://hub.docker.com/r/cupy/cupy).
```
$ docker run --gpus all -it cupy/cupy

```
