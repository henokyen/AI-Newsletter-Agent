**Falcon-40B is a 40B parameters causal decoder-only model built by[TII](https://www.tii.ae) and trained on 1,000B tokens of [RefinedWeb](https://huggingface.co/datasets/tiiuae/falcon-refinedweb) enhanced with curated corpora. It is made available under the Apache 2.0 license.**
_Paper coming soon üòä._
ü§ó To get started with Falcon (inference, finetuning, quantization, etc.), we recommend reading [this great blogpost fron HF](https://huggingface.co/blog/falcon)!
##  [ ](https://huggingface.co/tiiuae/falcon-40b/#why-use-falcon-40b) Why use Falcon-40B? 
  * **It is the best open-source model currently available.** Falcon-40B outperforms [LLaMA](https://github.com/facebookresearch/llama), [StableLM](https://github.com/Stability-AI/StableLM), [RedPajama](https://huggingface.co/togethercomputer/RedPajama-INCITE-Base-7B-v0.1), [MPT](https://huggingface.co/mosaicml/mpt-7b), etc. See the [OpenLLM Leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/HuggingFaceH4/open_llm_leaderboard).
  * **It features an architecture optimized for inference** , with FlashAttention ([Dao et al., 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.14135)) and multiquery ([Shazeer et al., 2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.02150)). 
  * **It is made available under a permissive Apache 2.0 license allowing for commercial use** , without any royalties or restrictions.
  * ‚ö†Ô∏è **This is a raw, pretrained model, which should be further finetuned for most usecases.** If you are looking for a version better suited to taking generic instructions in a chat format, we recommend taking a look at [Falcon-40B-Instruct](https://huggingface.co/tiiuae/falcon-40b-instruct).


üí∏ **Looking for a smaller, less expensive model?** [Falcon-7B](https://huggingface.co/tiiuae/falcon-7b) is Falcon-40B's little brother!

###  [ ](https://huggingface.co/tiiuae/falcon-40b/#direct-use) Direct Use 
Research on large language models; as a foundation for further specialization and finetuning for specific usecases (e.g., summarization, text generation, chatbot, etc.)
###  [ ](https://huggingface.co/tiiuae/falcon-40b/#out-of-scope-use) Out-of-Scope Use 
Production use without adequate assessment of risks and mitigation; any use cases which may be considered irresponsible or harmful. 
##  [ ](https://huggingface.co/tiiuae/falcon-40b/#bias-risks-and-limitations) Bias, Risks, and Limitations 
Falcon-40B is trained mostly on English, German, Spanish, French, with limited capabilities also in in Italian, Portuguese, Polish, Dutch, Romanian, Czech, Swedish. It will not generalize appropriately to other languages. Furthermore, as it is trained on a large-scale corpora representative of the web, it will carry the stereotypes and biases commonly encountered online.
###  [ ](https://huggingface.co/tiiuae/falcon-40b/#recommendations) Recommendations 
We recommend users of Falcon-40B to consider finetuning it for the specific set of tasks of interest, and for guardrails and appropriate precautions to be taken for any production use.

###  [ ](https://huggingface.co/tiiuae/falcon-40b/#model-architecture-and-objective) Model Architecture and Objective 
Falcon-40B is a causal decoder-only model trained on a causal language modeling task (i.e., predict the next token).
The architecture is broadly adapted from the GPT-3 paper ([Brown et al., 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165)), with the following differences:
  * **Positionnal embeddings:** rotary ([Su et al., 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.09864));
  * **Attention:** multiquery ([Shazeer et al., 2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.02150)) and FlashAttention ([Dao et al., 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.14135));
  * **Decoder-block:** parallel attention/MLP with a two layer norms.


For multiquery, we are using an internal variant which uses independent key and values per tensor parallel degree.
**Hyperparameter** | **Value** | **Comment**

Layers | 60  
`d_model` | 8192  
`head_dim` | 64 | Reduced to optimise for FlashAttention
