AdalFlow is a PyTorch-like library to build and auto-optimize any LM workflows, from Chatbots, RAG, to Agents.

# Why AdalFlow
[](https://github.com/SylphAI-Inc/AdalFlow/#why-adalflow)
  1. **Say goodbye to manual prompting** : AdalFlow provides a unified auto-differentiative framework for both zero-shot optimization and few-shot prompt optimization. Our research, `LLM-AutoDiff` and `Learn-to-Reason Few-shot In Context Learning`, achieve the highest accuracy among all auto-prompt optimization libraries.
  2. **Switch your LLM app to any model via a config** : AdalFlow provides `Model-agnostic` building blocks for LLM task pipelines, ranging from RAG, Agents to classical NLP tasks.

# AdalFlow: A Tribute to Ada Lovelace
[](https://github.com/SylphAI-Inc/AdalFlow/#adalflow-a-tribute-to-ada-lovelace)
AdalFlow is named in honor of [Ada Lovelace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace), the pioneering female mathematician who first recognized that machines could go beyond mere calculations. As a team led by a female founder, we aim to inspire more women to pursue careers in AI.
