CrewAI?\n[](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/#why-crewai)\n[![CrewAI Logo](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/raw/main/docs/asset.png)](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/blob/main/docs/asset.png)\nCrewAI unlocks the true potential of multi-agent automation, delivering the best-in-class combination of speed, flexibility, and control with either Crews of AI Agents or Flows of Events:\n  * **Standalone Framework** : Built from scratch, independent of LangChain or any other agent framework.\n  * **High Performance** : Optimized for speed and minimal resource usage, enabling faster execution.\n  * **Flexible Low Level Customization** : Complete freedom to customize at both high and low levels - from overall workflows and system architecture to granular agent behaviors, internal prompts, and execution logic.\n  * **Ideal for Every Use Case**

seamlessly together to build sophisticated AI applications:\n  1. **Crews** : Teams of AI agents with true autonomy and agency, working together to accomplish complex tasks through role-based collaboration. Crews enable:\n     * Natural, autonomous decision-making between agents\n     * Dynamic task delegation and collaboration\n     * Specialized roles with defined goals and expertise\n     * Flexible problem-solving approaches\n  2. **Flows** : Production-ready, event-driven workflows that deliver precise control over complex automations. Flows provide:\n     * Fine-grained control over execution paths for real-world scenarios\n     * Secure, consistent state management between tasks\n     * Clean integration of AI agents with production Python code\n     * Conditional branching for complex business logic\n\n\nThe true power of CrewAI emerges when combining Crews and Flows. This synergy allows you to:\n  * Build complex, production-grade applications\n  * Balance autonomy with precise control\n  * Handle sophisticated real-world scenarios\n  * Maintain clean, maintainable code structure\n\n\n### Getting Started with Installation\n[](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/#getting-started-with-installation)\nTo get started with CrewAI, follow these simple steps:\n### 1. Installation\n[](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/#1-installation)\nEnsure you have Python >=3.10 <3.13 installed on your system. CrewAI uses [UV](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for dependency management and package handling, offering a seamless setup and execution experience.\nFirst, install CrewAI:\n```\npip install crewai\n```\n\nIf you want to install the 'crewai' package along with its optional features that include additional tools for agents, you can do so by using the following command:\n```\npip install 'crewai[tools]'\n```\n\nThe command above installs the basic package and also adds extra components which require more dependencies to function.\n### Troubleshooting Dependencies\n[](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/#troubleshooting-dependencies)\nIf you encounter issues during installation or usage, here are some common solutions:\n#### Common Issues\n[](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/#common-issues)\n  1. **ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'tiktoken'**\n     * Install tiktoken explicitly: `pip install 'crewai[embeddings]'`\n     * If using embedchain or other tools: `pip install 'crewai[tools]'`\n  2. **Failed building wheel for tiktoken**\n     * Ensure Rust compiler is installed (see installation steps above)\n     * For Windows: Verify Visual C++ Build Tools are installed\n     * Try upgrading pip: `pip install --upgrade pip`\n     * If issues persist, use a pre-built wheel: `pip install tiktoken --prefer-binary`\n\n\n### 2. Setting Up Your Crew with the YAML Configuration\n[](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/#2-setting-up-your-crew-with-the-yaml-configuration)\nTo create a new CrewAI project, run the following CLI (Command Line Interface) command:\n```\ncrewai create crew <project_name>\n```\n\nThis command creates a new project folder with the following structure:\n```\nmy_project/\n├── .gitignore\n├── pyproject.toml\n├── README.md\n├── .env\n└── src/\n  └── my_project/\n    ├── __init__.py\n    ├── main.py\n    ├── crew.py\n    ├── tools/\n    │  ├── custom_tool.py\n    │  └── __init__.py\n    └── config/\n      ├── agents.yaml\n      └── tasks.yaml\n\n```\n\nYou can now start developing your crew by editing the files in the `src/my_project` folder. The `main.py` file is the entry point of the project, the `crew.py` file is where you define your crew, the `agents.yaml` file is where you define your agents, and the `tasks.yaml` file is where you define your tasks.\n#### To customize your project, you can:\n[](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/#to-customize-your-project-you-can)\n  * Modify `src/my_project/config/agents.yaml` to define your agents.\n  * Modify `src/my_project/config/tasks.yaml` to define your tasks.\n  * Modify `src/my_project/crew.py` to add your own logic, tools, and specific arguments.\n  * Modify `src/my_project/main.py` to add custom inputs for your agents and tasks.\n  * Add your environment variables into the `.env` file.\n\n\n#### Example of a simple crew with a sequential process:\n[](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/#example-of-a-simple-crew-with-a-sequential-process)\nInstantiate your crew:\n```\ncrewai create crew latest-ai-development\n```\n\nModify the files as needed to fit your use case:\n**agents.yaml**\n```\n# src/my_project/config/agents.yaml\nresearcher:\n role: >\n  {topic} Senior Data Researcher\n goal: >\n  Uncover cutting-edge developments in {topic}\n backstory: >\n  You're a seasoned researcher with a knack for uncovering the latest\n  developments in {topic}.

Here's how you can orchestrate multiple Crews within a Flow:\n```\nfrom crewai.flow.flow import Flow, listen, start, router\nfrom crewai import Crew, Agent, Task\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel\n# Define structured state for precise control\nclass MarketState(BaseModel):\n  sentiment: str = \"neutral\"\n  confidence: float = 0.0\n  recommendations: list = []\nclass AdvancedAnalysisFlow(Flow[MarketState]):\n  @start()\n  def fetch_market_data(self):\n    # Demonstrate low-level control with structured state\n    self.state.sentiment = \"analyzing\"\n    return {\"sector\": \"tech\", \"timeframe\": \"1W\"} # These parameters match the task description template\n  @listen(fetch_market_data)\n  def analyze_with_crew(self, market_data):\n    # Show crew agency through specialized roles\n    analyst = Agent(\n      role=\"Senior Market Analyst\",\n      goal=\"Conduct deep market analysis with expert insight\",\n      backstory=\"You're a veteran analyst known for identifying subtle market patterns\"\n    )\n    researcher = Agent(\n      role=\"Data Researcher\",\n      goal=\"Gather and validate supporting market data\",\n      backstory=\"You excel at finding and correlating multiple data sources\"\n    )\n    analysis_task = Task(\n      description=\"Analyze {sector} sector data for the past {timeframe}\",\n      expected_output=\"Detailed market analysis with confidence score\",\n      agent=analyst\n    )\n    research_task = Task(\n      description=\"Find supporting data to validate the analysis\",\n      expected_output=\"Corroborating evidence and potential contradictions\",\n      agent=researcher\n    )\n    # Demonstrate crew autonomy\n    analysis_crew = Crew(\n      agents=[analyst, researcher],\n      tasks=[analysis_task, research_task],\n      process=Process.sequential,\n      verbose=True\n    )\n    return analysis_crew.kickoff(inputs=market_data) # Pass market_data as named inputs\n  @router(analyze_with_crew)\n  def determine_next_steps(self):\n    # Show flow control with conditional routing\n    if self.state.confidence > 0.8:\n      return \"high_confidence\"\n    elif self.state.confidence > 0.5:\n      return \"medium_confidence\"\n    return \"low_confidence\"\n  @listen(\"high_confidence\")\n  def execute_strategy(self):\n    # Demonstrate complex decision making\n    strategy_crew = Crew(\n      agents=[\n        Agent(role=\"Strategy Expert\",\n           goal=\"Develop optimal market strategy\")\n      ],\n      tasks=[\n        Task(description=\"Create detailed strategy based on analysis\",\n           expected_output=\"Step-by-step action plan\")\n      ]\n    )\n    return strategy_crew.kickoff()\n  @listen(\"medium_confidence\", \"low_confidence\")\n  def request_additional_analysis(self):\n    self.state.recommendations.append(\"Gather more data\")\n    return \"Additional analysis required\"\n```\n\nThis example demonstrates how to:\n  1. Use Python code for basic data operations\n  2. Create and execute Crews as steps in your workflow\n  3. Use Flow decorators to manage the sequence of operations\n  4. Implement conditional branching based on Crew results\n\n\n## Connecting Your Crew to a Model\n[](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/#connecting-your-crew-to-a-model)\nCrewAI supports using various LLMs through a variety of connection options. By default your agents will use the OpenAI API when querying the model. However, there are several other ways to allow your agents to connect to models. For example, you can configure your agents to use a local model via the Ollama tool.\nPlease refer to the [Connect CrewAI to LLMs](https://docs.crewai.com/how-to/LLM-Connections/) page for details on configuring you agents' connections to models.\n## How CrewAI Compares\n[](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/#how-crewai-compares)\n**CrewAI's Advantage** : CrewAI combines autonomous agent intelligence with precise workflow control through its unique Crews and Flows architecture. The framework excels at both high-level orchestration and low-level customization, enabling complex, production-grade systems with granular control.\n  * **LangGraph** : While LangGraph provides a foundation for building agent workflows, its approach requires significant boilerplate code and complex state management patterns. The framework's tight coupling with LangChain can limit flexibility when implementing custom agent behaviors or integrating with external systems.\n\n\n_P.S. CrewAI demonstrates significant performance advantages over LangGraph, executing 5.76x faster in certain cases like this QA task example ([see comparison](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI-examples/tree/main/Notebooks/CrewAI%20Flows%20%26%20Langgraph/QA%20Agent)) while achieving higher evaluation scores with faster completion times in certain coding tasks, like in this example ([detailed analysis](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI-examples/blob/main/Notebooks/CrewAI%20Flows%20%26%20Langgraph/Coding%20Assistant/coding_assistant_eval.ipynb))._\n  * **Autogen** : While Autogen excels at creating conversational agents capable of working together, it lacks an inherent concept of process. In Autogen, orchestrating agents' interactions requires additional programming, which can become complex and cumbersome as the scale of tasks grows.\n  * **ChatDev** : ChatDev introduced the idea of processes into the realm of AI agents, but its implementation is quite rigid. Customizations in ChatDev are limited and not geared towards production environments, which can hinder scalability and flexibility in real-world applications.\n\n\n## Contribution\n[](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/#contribution)\nCrewAI is open-source and we welcome contributions.

When the `share_crew` feature is enabled, detailed data including task descriptions, agents' backstories or goals, and other specific attributes are collected to provide deeper insights while respecting user privacy. Users can disable telemetry by setting the environment variable OTEL_SDK_DISABLED to true.\nData collected includes:\n  * Version of CrewAI \n    * So we can understand how many users are using the latest version\n  * Version of Python \n    * So we can decide on what versions to better support\n  * General OS (e.g. number of CPUs, macOS/Windows/Linux) \n    * So we know what OS we should focus on and if we could build specific OS related features\n  * Number of agents and tasks in a crew \n    * So we make sure we are testing internally with similar use cases and educate people on the best practices\n  * Crew Process being used \n    * Understand where we should focus our efforts\n  * If Agents are using memory or allowing delegation \n    * Understand if we improved the features or maybe even drop them\n  * If Tasks are being executed in parallel or sequentially \n    * Understand if we should focus more on parallel execution\n  * Language model being used \n    * Improved support on most used languages\n  * Roles of agents in a crew \n    * Understand high level use cases so we can build better tools, integrations and examples about it\n  * Tools names available \n    * Understand out of the publicly available tools, which ones are being used the most so we can improve them\n\n\nUsers can opt-in to Further Telemetry, sharing the complete telemetry data by setting the `share_crew` attribute to `True` on their Crews. Enabling `share_crew` results in the collection of detailed crew and task execution data, including `goal`, `backstory`, `context`, and `output` of tasks. This enables a deeper insight into usage patterns while respecting the user's choice to share.\n## License\n[](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/#license)\nCrewAI is released under the [MIT License](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/blob/main/LICENSE).\n## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)\n[](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/#frequently-asked-questions-faq)\n### General\n[](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/#general)\n  * [What exactly is CrewAI?](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/#q-what-exactly-is-crewai)\n  * [How do I install CrewAI?](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/#q-how-do-i-install-crewai)\n  * [Does CrewAI depend on LangChain?](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/#q-does-crewai-depend-on-langchain)\n  * [Is CrewAI open-source?](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/#q-is-crewai-open-source)\n  * [Does CrewAI collect data from users?](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/#q-does-crewai-collect-data-from-users)\n\n\n### Features and Capabilities\n[](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/#features-and-capabilities)\n  * [Can CrewAI handle complex use cases?](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/#q-can-crewai-handle-complex-use-cases)\n  * [Can I use CrewAI with local AI models?](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/#q-can-i-use-crewai-with-local-ai-models)\n  * [What makes Crews different from Flows?](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/#q-what-makes-crews-different-from-flows)\n  * [How is CrewAI better than LangChain?](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/#q-how-is-crewai-better-than-langchain)\n  * [Does CrewAI support fine-tuning or training custom models?](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/#q-does-crewai-support-fine-tuning-or-training-custom-models)\n\n\n### Resources and Community\n[](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/#resources-and-community)\n  * [Where can I find real-world CrewAI examples?](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/#q-where-can-i-find-real-world-crewai-examples)\n  * [How can I contribute to CrewAI?](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/#q-how-can-i-contribute-to-crewai)\n\n\n### Enterprise Features\n[](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/#enterprise-features)\n  * [What additional features does CrewAI Enterprise offer?](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/#q-what-additional-features-does-crewai-enterprise-offer)\n  * [Is CrewAI Enterprise available for cloud and on-premise deployments?](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/#q-is-crewai-enterprise-available-for-cloud-and-on-premise-deployments)\n  * [Can I try CrewAI Enterprise for free?](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/#q-can-i-try-crewai-enterprise-for-free)\n\n\n### Q: What exactly is CrewAI?\n[](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/#q-what-exactly-is-crewai)\nA: CrewAI is a standalone, lean, and fast Python framework built specifically for orchestrating autonomous AI agents.
